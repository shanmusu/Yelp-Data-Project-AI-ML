jKhfsXol4FxbRjK8aUsLA,"Well I wish I could say something positive but I  honestly have never have waited this long at any little ceasers. I'm actually writing this review while I'm still sitting in the lobby.

I got here at 930pm, and it's now 10:04. When I ordered the guy behind the counter wasn't happy that I was here, but there was 5 other people waiting for pizza. 

I talked to some of them about their orders and everyone except for one person had only ordered 2 hot and readys. The other person only one.

Not only that but I would not recommend coming to this place late at night. Tons of sketchy people, bums, and people asking for money. I never thought I would be complaining about speed from lil ceasers.

And now they are complaining about the amount of people/orders they have to deal with it. I get it, it sucks that we ordered before you closed, but I was even here 30 minutes prior and I'm still waiting.

If you want pizza, order delivery. You will get it faster, not wait in a lobby for 30 minutes, and save on gas!",1,[],0,"[u' little ceasers', u"" n't happy""]",-0.5875

KWTv8elo9HiN9sIKvN0_bQ,"If you are in the area, craving some Chinese food, stop here.  That's it, this is by far some of the best Chinese food I have had in Arizona.  If that does not get you motivated wait till you see the prices....

The lunch specials are priced at $4.55 for a combo plate and $5.55 for the shrimp combo plates. With 20 different combos I am sure you will find something you like.  A soda will set you back $1.25 or go for 1 can of soda for .85 cents.  Hot tea and water was my choice.

The Restaurant just opened last month so it still needs some work....Some empty fish tanks, needs some ceiling pieces replaced, but it really is a great place for authentic fast food Chinese.  I wish this place was closer to my home since they offer delivery. Yes you have to spend over $12.00 for delivery, but that would be easy for dinner or an office ordering lunch.

If you are craving dinner and are on a budget you can still eat here.  Not one plate on the menu is over $8.00!  I think I ordered enough to feed a family 2 nights in a row, plus lunch for work and for about $30. 

OK so if price does not entice you the fresh food and delicious entrees will.  We ordered several different dishes and I cannot complain about any of them.  We loved the lo mein, beef egg foo young, Mongolian beef, fried rice, and cashew shrimp.  They gave us plenty of crab puffs for free as well plus a large container of white rice.  I generally am not a fan of the crab puffs, but the cream cheese was fresh and the fried puff seemed to be light and crispy.  

If you are on a diet or really watching your calorie intake they even have lo cal entrees on the menu, not the norm at a Chinese Restaurant.  Chicken, shrimp, or a vegetable plate for you serious calorie number watchers.

My family and I all loved the food here.  I hope you will give them an opportunity to earn your business.  The price for food is excellent and what shocked me more is the food is excellent.  Based on Max's review I gave it a shot and now my whole family is thanking me for a new found place to eat.

I looked at the reviews for it, but there weren't very many.  But I decided to take a risk.  When I drove up, I was a little scared.  It's not a fancy place by any means.   

My husband and I go to the counter to order.  It's one of those places where you order your food first then sit.  We chose the lo mein, cashew shrimp,  Mongolian beef, fried rice and beef egg foo young.  We got free cheese crab won ton for spending over $20.  

I was nervous to try this food.  You never know what you are going to get!  Well, it was soooooo good!  I finally found a great Chinese restaurant on the way home from work.  The egg foo young is a must and so is the lo mein.  I would order the cream cheese won tons again as well as the Mongolian beef.  I can't say anything good or bad about the shrimp.

We live near this restaurant and the other night the family and I out and about and were looking for some Chinese food.  I had noticed this place recently and decided I'd like to give it a try.  We were a little hesitant at first because this isn't the best neighborhood and the restaurant doesn't have the best curb appeal.  

Upon entering we found that the inside looks much nice/cleaner than the outside.  The dining room is very welcoming and the staff are very friendly.  It even smells clean!  

As we sat down and were preparing to order the waitress was chatting with my 7 year old daughter.  The waitress leaves and when she comes back she brings my daughter some egg rolls to munch on while we are thinking about our order.  I though this was awesome.  I ordered the Terriyaki Chicken (See Picture) and my wife ordered the Vegetable Chicken.  The terriaki chicken was AWESOME!, the texture was great, it had a crispy outter crust and perfectly cooked inside.  The presentation was great and visually appealling.  The terryiaki sauce was also excellent.  The egg rolls were great and tasted similar to Ling and Louies @ wild horse pass casino.  The rice was seasoned to perfection and included vegetables like carrots and peas.  The portions were large and were enough for 2 meals.  We definately needed a to go box.  Our meal came out to $17.00.  

This place ROCKS!  I will definately be recommending it to my friends and family.  We will be back soon.  Probably this week!  Lol.

All the food had a similar flavor that wasn't pleasant, burned oil maybe??? I was brought a cup of soup to start that was on the border of being cool, not cold but not warm either which made me wonder if it had been sitting from the night before as I was the first customer for lunch.

Did not walk out of this place having enjoyed my meal and actually said ""yuck"" when I got in the car. I thought the prices looked good until the bill came and a combo meal, ice tea and side of lo mein cost $20.

KWTv8elo9HiN9sIKvN0_bQ,"I don't often get over to this side of town, but I was referred to this place by a friend who owns another restaurant nearby. I went in and met with the owner who was really cool - it seems to be a family-run business - I think his parents are cooking the food. It was their grand opening (according to a hand drawn sign outside), but they could have been open for years the way the place was set up. It's clear they have run restaurants before or worked in the industry at least.

This place has a large dining area and it's a lot nicer inside than the outside would have you believe. The place is clean and smells good too. What's even better is that this place delivers... from 27th to 75th ave and from Buckeye to Bethany. 

I ordered the General Tso's Chicken with rice, some egg rolls and some wontons. It's always good to gauge a new restaurant by standard staples of the cuisine (that's why my first orders at pizza places are pepperoni etc.). First off - don't let the low prices fool you - the food is DAMN GOOD. Both me and my girlfriend devoured the egg rolls and wontons immediately and wished we had more. We both decided the chicken was on our list for being among the best we've had. 

I mean, for Chinese fast food that will deliver to your house, this is about as good as you can expect. It's clear they care about quality and speed and they seem really excited to be opening their own business. I really hope this place does well.

The place is very clean.  The pho is served in a bowl that's too small to be honest, I didn't have any room to put the bean sprouts in without it seeming like it would overflow the bowl. 

The fried rice is...well....average at most.  I wasn't the biggest fan, but once again...wasn't awful, i've just had better.

Lastly I had thai tea boba.  A bit too sweet for my taste, with not enough boba (which they also ""accidentally"" overcharged me for (they fixed the problem).

You can undress to your level of comfort (I would recommend an old bathing suit if you want tan lines) while Michele carefully sprays you down in the tent. Pretty cool. Michele's down-to-earth attitude also makes you feel at ease about the whole business of standing at attention while someone sprays bronzer onto your exposed bod.

The sushi is mostly stuff with Krab, there is a wide range of items all the usual's including a few good veggie options, and stuff for the kids like pizza french fries and chicken nuggets. 

One down side is the lack of accurate labels, this makes it hard to guess what is veggie and what is not.

C14bjKs2rJhRDnKu7ZSSIg,"I have been looking for a good Chinese Buffet for a while in my neighborhood and luckily Hibachi Grill has arrived. I have been to few Buffets in which the service was as quick, friendly and efficient. A sumptuously decorated Mid Century Modern Chinese decor makes you feel like you are eating at a fancy casino buffet. Lots of attractive attention to detail. So what ? I'm here for the food.

Only drawbacks- no dumplings- fried or steam or dim sum other than pork bun- which was great however. Also, no duck, hoisin or plum sauce, and if they did have it it was hard to find. BUT- they had wonderful egg custard tarts that were sublime- I am still obsessing ove them and that made of for what they lacked in other areas.

And the food did not disappoint. Great tot and sour soup with a perfect subtle taste of vinegar, delicious and hot cheese wontons, hell, they even had fried sweet plantains that were as good as my Cuban mother makes. 

Keep in mind, it's a buffet and I arrived it was the beginning of lunch so everything was hot and fresh. They offer the usual suspects from standard buffet fare, but all in high quality. Lots of shrimp and beef, and although I did not try the Hibachi Grill, it looked very appetizing  with lots of happy diners waiting in line to get their fix. The sushi bar was well stocked and fresh. Remember, it's a buffet, not Ra in Scottsdale. It was all very fresh. No "" low sodium"" soy sauce ? So what. 

All that, as well as 8 flavors of very premium ice cream for $6.99. God, I love America ! For a Chinese Buffet with this price for lunch, it is as good as it gets.

C14bjKs2rJhRDnKu7ZSSIg,"OK, so I haven't been to a buffet in a long time.  When I reflect on the idea of buffets -- Sweet Tomatoes excluded, since lots of salad means lots of Good-For-You-ness, right?... --  I feel like I used up my lifetime maximum instances of buffet-eating in college, where the dining halls were all-you-can eat.  Anyway, this place just opened and is within walking distance of where I live, so my neighbors and I decided to check it out.  

Overall I wasn't very impressed with the food, even in comparison to other Chinese food buffets I've been to in the past.  In addition to a standard selection of Chinese buffet items (beef with broccoli, fried rice, sweet and sour chicken) they have sushi, pizza (for kids, I'm assuming), and a hibachi grill section where you can pick vegetables and meats and they'll stir fry it for you (included in the buffet price).  The hibachi stir fry I made up was OK, but the sauce added to it was too salty for me.  The sushi was bland and what you would expect from a grocery store.  They only had regular high-sodium soy sauce, as far as I could tell.  (I tried asking one of the wait staff for low-sodium soy sauce and there was a language barrier; he brought back another staff member to our table, who also didn't understand what I was asking.)  The egg roll I tried was really salty (even without sauce) and nothing to write home about.  Usually sweet & sour sauce can make even mediocre egg rolls worth eating, but the S&S sauce on the buffet was a downright-scary Kool-Aid-red color.  However, the fresh pineapple and melon was a nice touch, as were the 8 different ice cream flavors on the far end of the line.

I will say it was pretty cheap at $10 per adult, so if you're looking for a lot of food on a budget, it might be a decent option for you.  Personally though, I just think I am past the days of eating foods with scary salt levels, artificial colors, etc., so I won't plan on going back (though if I had to return for some reason, there are enough edible options so that I wouldn't starve).",2,"[u' very impressed', u' fresh pineapple', u' nice touch', u' pretty cheap']",2.225,"[u' sour chicken', u' even mediocre', u' scary salt', u' artificial colors']",-1.975

I did not like the lay out of the place at all, as previous reviewers touched upon, it is one line and things get congested too easily. It makes for an unpleasant visit when you are heading to the buffet.

The food itself was decent quality, by buffet standards, they have the basics, seafood, basic american cuisine like chicken nuggets, pizza, sushi, and other asian cuisine like sweet N sour items, orange chicken, etc. The sushi was quite bland, the salad bar was pretty terrible, the lettuce was quite limp, and the main courses were nothing that stood out. Usually when I go to a buffet there is one or two items that I'd find above average, but here I cannot really think of anything that went beyond the average column. 

If I were to give this business advice, it would be to restructure their buffet line to help with people getting bogged down, and to offer a bit more variety and up their food quality. Most chinese buffets I've been too have had a salmon dish, there was none to be found here, the only fish dishes I found were a grilled fish (which was not edible, it tasted disgusting and bland) and deep fried Tilapia which was extremely bony. Just one example of the poor variety they have here.

Sonoran Hot Dog: (the best I've had so far in phoenix). I've never been to a hot dog place that grilled the bun. It was unique and yet an amazing idea. Ir reminded me of a Texas toast with the flavor of your usual sweet Sonoran bun. The problem with Sonoran hot dog is that you rarely taste the actual hot dog(wiener/frank/sausage or however you refer to it), here you could taste the bacon wrapped hot dog. The beans are simmered in chorizo which adds a twist to the usual sonoran dogs I've tasted. They add the usual tomato, onion, mustard, ketchup, mayo and guacamole. 
Definitely a most. 

They name themselves a Taqueria. So we had to taste the tacos. We had pastor, asada, cabeza and tripitas. They had authentic street taco flavors. The asada and pastor were definitely the winners. The pastor was not your typical pastor/adobada flavor but very good. Their salsa are very tasty. The red is really spicy but with the taste you would expect of a mexican street taco place.

The most moist and tenderly seasoned  lamb!   Practically melts in your mouth.   Large portion.   Get the kabob with rice and order a specialty naan on the side. 

Fluffy tender rice with a strong cumin flavor laced in every bite.  I don't usually eat much rice, but the house rice was a delicious treat.. The Lamb came with a Cucumber tomato onion and cilantro mixed salad. 

I also ordered the Garlic naan.  nom nom nom.... The bread was perfectly tender with a lite crunch and bursting with the flavors of roasted and fresh garlic.

Deliciously spiced beef.   Reminds me more if a Jamaican beef patty,  spicier and more flavorful.   The chicken samosa is just as yummy,  but lacks the bold flavors of the beef.   Rather spicy for most Americans.

zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q,"I'm seriously beginning to question, whether Yelp reviewers are actually former incarcerated felons, who had such lousy food in jail, that almost anything decent will merit 4 or 5 stars.  Seriously:  what about this place rates 4 or 5 stars?!?  Yeah, the kids, who help run the place are adorable and well-mannered, but that's not a reason to rave about the restaurant ... or is it?  

Let's talk about what's NOT cute:

One of our companions ordered the kabli pulao from the menu.  He did state, that the meat was fairly decently spiced, but the rest of the dish was pretty bland.  His plate, for some reason, came with plain pilaf, which did even less to relieve the blandness.  My plate had the Afghan rice with raisins, so it was a little better.  However, the presentation of the kabli leaves something to be desired.  I would seriously consider altering its shape, since it arrives at your table shaped like a long .... Well, let's just say, I wondered whether one of my dogs from home got into the restaurant and had an accident on his plate  (my companion assures me, that would not have been possible as the food would then have had more flavor than it did).

I had the lamb shank.  It, too, came with enough rice to feed an Afghan family of 7.  And, as much as I love carbs, most of it sat on my plate at meal's end.  The lamb was very fatty, but, hey, that's what gives it taste.  Unfortunately, it was the ONLY dish with lamb available at the restaurant (which, for an Afghani restaurant is as bizarre as going to an Italian restaurant and them not having pasta!).

As an appetizer, I had the hummus, which was -- surprise -- bland.  The bread they serve with it -- allegedly naan -- bore an amazing resemblance to Little Caesar's cheesy bread.  Good, but not naan in any sense of the word I know.

My partner had the chicken tikki masala, which, to me, looked almost like pho (soup) when it came out.  However, he said it was not only very good, but creamy.  They did not, however, bother to ask him how spicy he wanted it, so it came out in a neutral, middle spiciness, which, according to him, added just enough spice to avoid it being --- you got it --- bland.

Service was attentive and extraordinarily polite, especially when considering our server probably doesn't yet know how to shave.

Overall, we won't be coming back here.  The food was bland and nothing particularly exciting.  If, as one of the reviewers stated, the cooking reminds her of how mom made dinner at home, she should immediately close Yelp, drive to mom's, and blow up her pots and pans.

Many of the reviewers here have written, that the dishes come with plenty of food.  But this isn't exactly true:  when it comes down to it, the main dish portions aren't big at all and you're served truckloads of cheap rice to fill out the dishes.

As my partner stated:  ""you really have to read these reviews with a grain of salt"".  

Perhaps.  But if you intend to take reviews of this place with a grain of salt, make sure to bring your own with you:  as bland as the food is here, you won't find any salt laying around to use",2,"[u' as bizarre', u' amazing resemblance', u' very good', u' extraordinarily polite', u' particularly exciting', u' exactly true', u' cheap rice']",3.293333333,"[u' lousy food', u' very fatty']",-0.76

There's clearly a trick in the menus; there are no combos of two items. The closest thing is the mixed grill but that's way too much for one person and the proportion is for at least two people.  So, what do you do when, for example, you want to combine lamb and chicken (1 skewer each)? In my case, I added the chicken boti with my lamb but the extra charge was $7.99 so my single order, a custom combo, came out to be about $18.00!!! No rice!

zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q,"I love this place. My go-to is the paneer tikka masala, which is more aromatic and tomato-y than the sweet stuff you get from frozen dinners or at Indian places. Also, I love eating vegetarian as much as possible. When I'm craving the good stuff and am willing to sacrifice innocent animals for the purpose, I go for the goat biryani. Guessing by how frequently the place is packed with people, these dishes are perfectly representative. I also recommend the hummus appetizer if you're looking for some tasty to go with your numnum.

The big warning to take in if you go to this place is that if you aren't a leftovers person or won't be able to pack leftovers, you should really plan on sharing a meal. I tend to go here and eat until it hurts and still have enough for lunch the next day. I like to go and split an appetizer and plate with a friend, and I always leave more than full.

Last note, the service here is wonderful. The owners run the shop themselves and are very friendly and appreciative of your business.

The Bad and the Ugly: The Saag Paneer was DISGUSTING.  It was bland as hell.  I had one spoonful and tossed it.  And their Goat Karahi, which is a dish that is close to my heart, was DISGUSTING and watery.  How does karahi get that watery?  It actually looked weird.  It did not taste like it was cooked in a wok, the spices and tomatoes were not cooked down at all, and there was an inch layer of fake ghee on top.   And when I asked for it to be spicy, someone just dumped pickled jalapeños in the dish---which made it look less like a karahi.  And I love goat meat but this tasted so gamey and it really looked unappealing, I also threw away 90% of this dish.  And the naan, as someone else said, was thick and spongy, with a yeasty after taste.  I hated it.  Everything was $34 and I threw away practically all of it --- it was nasty to me.

Started off with some Chicken and Beef Samosas and went with the famous Chicken Tikka Masala extra spicy. It was delicious and had plenty of tasty flavors bursting in my mouth. The heat level was very high and perfect for my taste buds. Nice!

Came back again and ordered the Kabli Pulao (Kofta) plate. Again the portion size and the flavors were exceptional and even had some left to bring home. Really love the way she makes the rice with the raisins and carrots in the dish. Going to have to try and reproduce this bad boy at home.

They have a rather large menu that can accommodate almost any diet or request. Appetizers, Snacks, Kababs, Currys, Wraps, Burgers, and Vegetarian choices if you are in the mood for a meat free meal. They also have a good variety of sweet Desserts to cap off your visit.

I would have to guess that they have a hard time when faced with large parties but everything came out at roughly the same time and my food was hot when it arrived.

My favorite bite of the night actually came from the Yelper seated across the table from me.  She ordered the mantoo and graciously traded bites with me for some of my kabli pulao.  The mantoo consists of bite and a half sized ground beef and onion dumplings with a meat sauce and a yogurt sauce on top.  I really, really liked the combination of flavors and the presentation was simple yet beautiful.  I would have gladly eaten an entire order!

My entree was a ground beef kebab that was over a foot long and beautifully seared with a really pronounced charcoal flavor.  It came on a bed of Afghani rice which included raisins and carrots.  Savory and well seasoned, it completed the dish.  That said, the beef was a little dry and benefited from the occasional dunking in the yogurt sauce.

I also had a beef samosa that was a steal for a buck.  It came with a sauce that included jalapenos so I had to leave that part of the dish alone.  The others at the table who sampled it had great things to say, including the description of it tasting green.  Plenty of green ingredients and it looked like something I would have enjoyed if it didn't include the one green ingredient I cannot eat.  The samosa itself was just about perfect.  I really liked the addition of several different peppers in the meat mixture both for the flavors they added and the color.  They were fried perfectly and were the right balance between tender and crunchy.

With 1hr and 10mins to closing and a $20 cab ride the 4of us entered with great anticipation. No greeting, no smile, no eye contact even. The first words spoken to us upon entering the door were, ""takeout only."" I said, ""pardon me""? And the response came back even more dry, ""takeout only."" When I mentioned we have arrived with ample time to be seated, the guy made eye contact, raised his voice and said in a firm voice, ""TAKEOUT ONLY.""

Informed him that we are from out of town staying at a hotel and cannot do takeout he said not his problem. 
Asked why takeout only, he said they've run out of some items on the menu. That is understandable so I decided to reason with a compromise. I asked to let us order from what remains on the menu so we can be seated. Surely a win-win I thought. This guy just didn't care. He said no matter what we order he would tell us he was out. And in the next breath said, takeout only.

Abdullah does not care for his customers, nor did he seem to be concerned about how rude and unprofessional he was being. He used words like that's not my problem and I don't care.

Small ethnic restaurants are not always attractive, comfortable, or even clean, but Khyber excels in all of these areas.  The staff is attentive and friendly.  The menu is varied but not so large as to make you suspicious about how much frozen food is served - I believe everything here is freshly prepared.  The portions are large, the prices are low, and the food is nearly as good as it gets for this type of establishment.  So how could Khyber be better?: Well, I wish they were located in my neighborhood, and the food could be spiced a little more heavily, particularly as regards salt.  Other than that ... well I gave it five stars.

I can particularly recommend the Mantoo, a kind of ravioli dish with meat-stuffed dumplings in a surprisingly good beef-yogurt sauce.  The ""Salad"" (for under $2) is a large portion of a cucumber-tomato-onion chopped salad, and is a perfect relish for the Mantoo.  There are a number of vegitarian dishes served with Nan.  We had the Bamya (okra) which needed salt but was otherwise perfectly prepared.  The Nan here is thick, like a thick-crust pizza, and they give you enough to make a meal of on its own.  If you have room for dessert, I can recommend the Phirni - a pudding whose ingredients we were told are secret, but it tastes like a cross between rice pudding and custard and is superb.

All of her meat entrees are halal.

Our first visit we had beef samosa and shami kabob for appetizers. Each came with fresh green chutney and tasted as if she had just freshly hand made the dough, meat, and chutney.

THIS PLACE IS FRICKING AMAZING, the service was excellent as well as friendly and it smells simply divine.

2) Mantoo...this was possibly the star of an all-star show. We decided that they reminded us of dumplings or of non-fried crab rangoon, only filled with ground beef, seasonings and topped with one (technically two?) of the most delightful sauces ever. 

3) Chicken Tikka Masala - I chose medium spicy this time...you know I HAD to have it. And it was delicious. (We also had the basmati rice with this one because it's a saucy dish and that's how I like it...if you ask nicely, they may let you substitute the naan that it comes with for rice instead)

4) Beef samosas AND Chicken samosas...both were fantastic, but I think I loved the beef one just a *little* bit more. The seasoning was superb. We also dipped it into the sauce that came with the mantoo...OMFG...wow. 

5) Garlic naan...I've never met a garlic naan that I didn't like.

6) Baklawa (aka baklava)...one of the best I've ever had. Nutty and honey-ey...mmmm...

Just strange names. We ordered and sat down. 35-40 minutes later, we realized the food still hadn't come and we'd never make it out to Scottsdale for our movie. So, disappointed, we took the food when it finally came and brought it home and ordered something up on Amazon. When I dove into the ""to go"" boxes, I stopped complaining. Man, that food was delicious. I ordered the Chicken Tikka, only because I pretty much knew what it would be, and it far beat my expectations.

Trust me, in your lifetime everyone should try a Gulab jamun. In laymen's terms that would be a little ball of dough. Two of these ping pong sized balls come in a container. You won't want to share. I mean, the civil thing would be to share. But really, once your spoon touches the sweet cardamom syrup that's involved. Mmm...I don't think so. A moment on the lips a memory forever.

Spicy means hot! (If you opt for spicy be prepared.) The Chicken Tikka Masala was divine with copious amounts of chicken. Served with four large artistically cut pieces of naan leftovers abound.  The Kabli Pulao really does come with a foot long serving of a beef shish kabob.  (The beef has been shredded and molded into this arc of a shape.)

My mother ordered a goat stew dish. Before she even bite into it she smelled something funny. She decided to at least give it a try. She could not believe what she tasted. It was very old and rotten (the goat). 

I was shocked. I didn't know how to tell the waitress. I decided to politely tell her what had happened to at least warn her that something was wrong with the meat. I went to also grab a plate for my mom to share my food. As I was talking to the waitress, another lady popped up (I'm assuming was the cook). She insisted that it's normal and goat always smelled like that and that my mother must have not had goat before. I told her that she actually has and cooks it at home all the time. I saw she was offended and got awkward so I went back to my table to eat. 

When I was paying, I asked if I was going to be charged for the entree my mom didn't eat and that she picked up. She (the cook/manager) said yes you have to pay, then started to attack me. She stated that other people had eaten that same dish earlier and loved it. That we were offending her.

I told her calmly that I didn't mind paying for it. It wasn't a big deal. I was just shocked at her rudeness and lack of customer service.

Everything on the menu looked good, and maybe I should have read more reviews, because I ordered way too much.

If you have been here you know this is an obscene amount of food... I did not know that and was shocked when the plates came out. Let's start with the good:

The samosa was delicious and the cilantro sauce that came with it was amazing... delicious with a touch of spiciness. 

The service was fabulous... attentive and timely for such a large group.

The dumplings were really yummy and different than anything I have ever tasted. Plus there were like 10 of them on the plate.... they were tasty. I would get them again for sure. 

The bread was fresh, warm, and delicious.... oh, and plentiful. 

The prices- this place was inexpensive... I could have fed 6 people for 30$

Ok, now for the bad:

The chicken tikka masala came out completely not spicy.... maybe they didn't hear me, or something got lost in the large order, but it was not at all spicy and just tasted kind of boring.... The portion was large, but if the flavor is there, it really doesn't matter. 


The side of rice was maybe the worst thing I got. It was huge and tasted.... off. It's hard to describe, but it tasted like oil that has been used one too many times.... just kind of weird. I'm not sure if that's how it's supposed to taste, but if it is... yikes.... not awesome.

The karahi was by far the best - very tender and moist chicken that I mopped up with naan.  Tikka Masala was also tasty and had a nice kick (you can adjust spice levels).  The rice:goat ratio on the biryani was high and while I usually like goat, this was a bit gamey and dry. 

Service was slow given there weren't many other diners at the restaurant.  However, portions were huge and very reasonably priced.  Total bill was $44 for 4  and we left stuffed with 4 full boxes of leftovers.

The cuisine is mix of Indian, Pakistani and Afghan, designed to suit every taste, from spicy to not so spicy.   I have had several items but , such as the tender and juicy lamb kabob and most recently the Chicken Boti which was spicy and very good!  They serve goat, lamb, beef and chicken in a variety of dishes and many are able to be shared.

The service is somewhat slower because you generally have the owner being the watier and the menu explainer.  He will take the time to explain the food, how it is prepared and what may suit the taste you are looking for.   His wife loves to cook and that is how this place got started.  Interior decor is nothing special, very typical of an authentic place that just serves good authentic food!.  The Nan bread is fresh, warm and tender.  The hummus didn't really fit my taste, I have other places that I prefer hummus, it was more oily than most.  When I was in there last night, There are approximately 10 tables in the place and during my last visit I could overhear each table making comments about how good their food was.  

There is a charge for bottled water (if you ask for ""water) and you will pay a .35 cent transaction fee for credit cards, testament again..to authenticity :)  

I love this place and when I feel the itch for something different and adventurous for my taste buds,  I have not been disappointed yet.

I later hosted my own MeetUp dinner here, ordered family style which I pre-selected with th owner, Fahima, for 22 people.   Some of the dishes Fahima and I selected for my group are Mixed Grill Meat Platter (Usbek Puloa, Kofta, chicken kabob), Goat Khari, Mantoo (meat dumplings topped with yogurt sauce), Gulpi (cauliflower stew), Badanjan (eggplant, oh I love eggplant),  Tandori Garlic and Paratha Naan, cucumber salad (comes with entrees), and Afghani rice flavored with cardamom seed (comes with entrees), and we each got one Beef Samosa.   We were served immediately upon arrival with hot dishes, and great service from her sons.  Because I ordered more goat and lab dishes, our bill still came out to less than $13 a person. including tax and tip.

It might be my new favorite restaurant in this city.  The food was amazing.  The service was wonderful.  The value was outstanding. The prices are beyond reasonable for what you get (taking into account both flavor and portion size).  Don't let the location scare you.  Consider it a blessing.  It's probably how they keep prices down. 

I ordered the Chicken Karahi (large portion, so that I'd have leftovers for lunch the next day).  It's a miraculous mixture of chicken perfectly cooked, in a ginger/jalapeno/tomato based sauce that's so delicious and fragrant, served with naan bread.  I ordered it medium hot, and the spices were perfect.  Definitely warm, but not so hot you can't enjoy your food. It's only 10am next day, and I've already broken into the take-home carton and had it for breakfast.  YUM.  Even better second day, if that's possible. 

My hubby ordered the Mantoo.  HEAVEN.  He cleaned his entire plate off (and then helped himself to my Karahi...which at the time I was cool with... but today.. I wish I'd have told him to keep his grubby hands to himself... I would have had enough left for breakfast AND lunch.)

We were stuffed, but had to try the Gulub Jaman for dessert.  We weren't disappointed.  Two balls of doughy goodness, resting in a sweet syrup of heaven.  They aren't large.  Small actually.  The perfect amount to cap off an amazing meal with, without pushing you over gluttony's precarious edge.

zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q,"This place has some seriously delicious food, but the service isn't going to wow you (I suggest take-out if you're wary). And, now that you've been warned, on to the deliciousness!

I shared veggie kabob and rice, beef egg rolls, and chicken tikka masala. I'm happy to say that you get a ton of food with your order! The veggie kabobs were served on a huge bed of rice, and they were super fresh and flavorful. They're simple, but great! The egg rolls, which are only $0.99 a pop, were also very tasty, albeit a little greasy (they're deep-fried egg rolls though). I also can't forget to mention that the egg rolls come with a great spicy sauce! 

And then there was chicken tikka masala... At $10.99 it's not the cheapest thing on the menu, but DAMN! It was sincerely some of the best chicken tikka masala that I've had in the valley (almost inching out one of my favorites at Z-Grill). They served it with an enormous piece of house-made naan. The masala was perfectly balanced in spiciness and thickness, and the chicken was cooked just right! Masala lovers from all over should try it!

zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q,"I will start with the positives: the staff is exceedingly friendly and attentive, the restrooms are clean, and the restaurant is clean. 
Now with the negatives: the food. I have eaten Indian food all over the country (San Francisco, Sacramento, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Baltimore, New York, Washington, the list goes on). I LOVE Indian food. If I had to choose a dying meal, it would be paneer masala with naan and basmati. 
This restaurant served literally the least authentic Indian food I have ever eaten. They tried, but it is painfully Americanized, and I should have known based on the ""whitebread"" patrons here. They even serve hamburgers??? 
They did not serve basmati, instead it was just long grain white or brown rice, and very little seasoning. Their naan tasted like cheap, reheated, store bought pita bread, their sauces/curries were bland and lacking dimension, and the rest of their fare was the most average food I have ever had. 
I tried this place because two other restaurants closer to me had a whole star less than this place (including the place recommended below), so I thought... It MUST be better. I was wrong.

zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q,"Mediterranean cuisine is one of my favorites, so I was really looking forward to a great meal from Khyber Halal. I really wanted to like this place, based on all my fellow Yelpers' reviews, but, in my opinion, it just wasn't up to snuff. 

I checked them out on a Friday night after work, looking to grab a few items to go. After entering the hole-in-the-wall location (which I love, by the way), I was greeted from behind the counter by an older gentlemen and a few teenagers. You could tell this was truly a family run operation.

After perusing the menu for a bit, I asked for a few recommendations. I'm a pretty adventurous eater, so I told them to throw the best of the bunch at me. He suggested the Uzbak Pulao, which was grilled lamb on top of a rice mixture (carrots, currants, and bits of meat...I'm assuming it was lamb or goat). My husband ordered the Chicken Handi, which was grilled chicken with a spicy rub over rice (nothing fancy here).  We also ordered Naan and a side of hummus.

We got home and dove into our meals, which by the way, was enough to feed a family of four, if not six. My lamb was chewy (I ordered it medium rare) with very little flavor, and the rice mixture was bland and oily (probably from all the meat). The Naan had no flavor at all, either, and after a certain point, I felt like I was eating a chewy piece of cardboard. By far the worst of the bunch was the hummus. It was literally mashed up chickpeas with no additional ingredients (tahini, anyone? Maybe a little lemon juice?). It was bland as can be.  To be fair, my husband enjoyed his chicken, but it doesn't take a lot to please his palate. I also tried his rice, and it was nothing special. 

While this place is a killer value and and a sweet family run establishment, we, sadly, won't be returning.",2,"[u' great meal', u' pretty adventurous', u' certain point', u' sweet family']",1.739285714,[u' very little'],-0.24375

zNGYsFeG_7XEBodbtfux5Q,"Santi and I discovered this Afghan restaurant on Yelp and came to visit on several occasions. The horizontal interior was equip with a front counter, overhead menu, good number of tables, moderate lighting, and maps and images of Afghanistan. The atmosphere can be sparse, but still home-like based on previous visits.

The Uzbek Pulaw ($13.99) encompassed one skewer of lamb cubes, cucumber salad, and Afghan rice. The lamb was tasty and nicely seasoned, but was also too small when measured against the Chicken Boti. As a national dish, the Afghan rice came with bits of lamb, shredded carrots, and raisins buried into the rice mixture. We unexpectedly found lamb innards due to its metallic flavor, and the brothy sauce that was used for seasoning had an off-putting profile. Portions were generous, but comparatively, the Chicken Boti was the better choice.

The Chicken Karahi ($12.99) arrived with half of a chicken served in a ginger, jalapeno, tomato sauce, and our choice of Tandoori Chili Naan. The combination of dark and white meat was tender and sensational. The cooked-down flavors of ginger and jalapeno provided the spiciness, and the tomato sauce helped round out the sharp edges. Serving was plentiful. We wished the dish came with more heat and sauce for the rice, but this was our favorite dish at this restaurant.

The Lamb Shank ($12.99) came with one large bulky piece of lamb shank, cucumber salad, and Afghan rice. The lamb was easy to fork off the bones, but there was little seasoning to alter the gaminess. Unlike other Afghan restaurants, the profile of their rice carried a strange oily aftertaste. The cucumber salad was served in room temperature and tasted more like a filler than anything else.

The Chicken Boti ($9.99) came with one skewer of chicken breast marinated with spices. The chicken skewer was sizable, tender, delicious, and nicely seasoned. The sides of cilantro and yogurt sauces were delicious. Interested diners should note that the regular basmati rice was the better option when compared to the Afghan rice that tend to overwhelm the flavor of the skewers. 

The Tandoori Chili Naan ($2.99) came with large pieces covered with cilantro and jalapeno. The spicy tandoori flavors were captivating to couple with the delightful thick and crispy textures. There was a resounding crunch in every bite. 

The location in the strip mall provided ample parking. Interested diners should expect large portions, reasonable prices, home-like atmosphere, and down-to-earth customer service. Despite shortcomings, there are still plenty to look forward to on their menu. I would be  returning to try the Goat Karachi, Paneer Tikka Masala, Eggplant, Cauliflower, Okra, and Garlic Naan.",3,"[u' good number', u' favorite dish', u' Interested diners', u' delightful thick', u' Interested diners', u' reasonable prices']",2.25,"[u' too small', u' sharp edges']",-0.375

Their weekday lunch specials include a chicken or gyro pita with a side or a salad with chicken or gyro meat. First, their pita is homemade and literally to die for.  The chicken is grilled to perfection and tender and juicy and the marinade/seasoning is heavenly!  The gyro meat is also incredible.

Their pizzas (the dough is the pita bread dough) are all amazing as well.

George is the chef and owner and is usually there. He's great. His wife and kids take orders and deliver the food. They are all welcoming and fun. 

There is a counter by the drinks where there is usually a selection of ""free"" items to try. Usually pizza bread (slices of homemade crusty bread with tomato sauce, cheese and sausage or pepperoni), bread slices, and homemade baklava.

The prices aren't crazy, the serving size is great, just enough to cover lunch and not have leftovers or still be hungry.

3U__XOTBFptjhBeHrPGqrg,"Worst baklava ever.  I've never had any this bad, not even from a mall food court place back when the Fiesta Mall still had Macy's.  The bottom layer was burnt.  The inner layers weren't golden and crispy but white and pasty.  The worst part was that it has NO honey or syrup at all on the inside layers.  None.  It was just layers of dry sheets of pale white dough and chopped nuts.  There was a tiny token drizzle on top that the cashier girl squeezed on it before she boxed it up, and that's it.  I don't think the layers of dough were brushed with butter either.  It's awful, and definitely not worth the $3.50 they're charging for two small triangular pieces.  Costco and AJ's both have superior product, and Costco even manages a shelf-stable baklava that is much more moist, even if not drenched in honey or syrup like some plates (most anything would be moister than this was).

I got the calamari again and the serving size was very small for the $9.50 they're charging (I'm pretty sure it's much smaller than what I got last time).  It could've used a crispier coating, and was slightly too rubbery.  The pita was still quite good.

They really need to get fabric or rubber pads for the metal feet of the chairs in the dining room as the noise against the flooring is awful.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"It has been 7 years since I last visited The White Chocolate Grill at Scottsdale, AZ. Back then, I was dating a good friend of mine. I guess the date went so well and the food was really good, she ended up marrying me 4 years after. After dating for 4 years and married for 3 years, my now wife and I decided to revisit The White Chocolate Grill.

Now in our casual attire instead of a dress and a suit, we got a chance to enjoy and focus on the food, the service and the ambience of the place. I did remember one particular appetizer from their menu. They still had the Grilled Artichoke. I loved it so much back then that I tried to eat everything on the plate. Even the choke and the leaves ( just to be honest, I didn't know which part to eat. So I ate everything. I was trying to be cool. I WAS ON A DATE!!! Note: only eat the heart).

The Food: We had the Ahi Tuna Salad and the Grilled Chicken Madeira for dinner and the White Chocolate Brownie for dessert. Everything was fantastic! 

The Ahi Tuna salad was very light and refreshing. The sesame crusted Ahi Tuna was seared rare to perfection and served with field greens, mango, avocado, cherry tomatoes and cucumbers then lightly dressed with a champagne vinaigrette. The combination of the tangy and sweet vinaigrette complemented the salt water freshness of the ahi tuna. The sesame crust and avocado gave texture to each bite. The mango and cherry tomatoes gave balance to the dish while the greens and cucumber gave the fresh taste in your mouth that makes you believe that you are actually eating something healthy.

The Grilled Chicken Madeira was hearty and satisfying. A serving plate had 3 pieces of marinated chicken breasts grilled to order and then served in a savory mushroom sauce with a hint of tarragon and a choice of side. We decided to go with the Israeli Couscous topped with roasted pistachios. The chicken breast was very tender and juicy. It was also seasoned well enough to stand on its own even without the mushroom sauce. I did find the mushroom sauce a tad on the salty side (it can be overlooked since it compliments with the couscous).  The couscous was a winner! It was al dente to the bite and was seasoned well. The chopped mint leaves and apple slices cuts through the savory mushroom sauce that just complimented each other so well. The dried cranberry and toasted pistachio provided texture, contrast and balance for the dish. I wouldn't hesitate to order this again on my next visit. 

The White Chocolate Brownie was a warm blonde brownie with white chocolate shavings and topped with French Vanilla Ice Cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream. It is sweet! Literally! I guess theres a reason why the menu says ""Desserts for Two"". Because the dessert is meant to be shared. It would be overwhelmingly sweet for one person to finish the whole plate. Just imagine the combination of the blonde brownie, chocolate sauce and chocolate shavings. Even the vanilla ice cream and whipped cream is not enough to cut through the sweetness. Don't get me wrong. It's not bad. I actually think it's a good way to end your meal while enjoying a cup of coffee and a good (or maybe sweet) conversation. Just take time enjoying the dessert.

The Service: Our server for the night was Angel. She was an angel. She recommended the Israeli Couscous over the Mardi Gras Rice for our Grilled Chicken Madeira. I think it was the perfect side for the savory mushroom sauce. She also kept our glass full. Which means she kept track of our meal the whole time. Since we mentioned that my wife and I were sharing everything, extra plates and utensils were always provided as each order was served. We never felt rushed and we never felt unattended. It is worth noting that it was a busy dinner service at the time we were there. Kudos to Angel!

The Ambience: The whole place was very cozy and relaxed. There was an area with a bar and the latest sporting event for the night on TV. There was also an area where you enjoy your meal with a good conversation. It is both classic and sophisticated.

Overall, it was a great meal experience. Good food, good service and overall nice and relax place. Now, why did I to wait for 7 years before the second visit? With this kind of a quality restaurant, maybe the third visit should be anytime soon.

If you're looking to not spend a great deal of money just get a burger (and their white chocolate bread pudding!), they're delicious and worth it. 

Also, make sure you make a reservation in advance for Friday and Saturday nights because, it can get PACKED. 

Lastly, it's good for any night really, a family dinner, friends/ladies night, date night, etc. It's a classy place with style.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"This is the place to be apparently!  Excellent service, good food, and heaters on the patio! 

My experience with the restaurant is from hosting a happy hour for an organization in which I am involved. 

Parking: easy - it's in this shopping center with all these other stores, similar to one of the other billions of outdoor strip mall type things in the valley. 

Service: amaze! We had a very handsome guy and lady help us out for the happy hour event. They were attentive, nice, and provided suggestions. This was a happy hour for individuals in the health field, and they provided ideas for veg-based foods.  The waters were refilled every few minutes, and the food came out super quickly and was good. 

Food:   One can order happy hour foods only at the bar, so we did not.  We ordered: Chips and guac, ahi tuna, chips and artichoke dip, Brusells sprouts, caprese salad, roasted carrots, and a few other items for folks to share.  The grilled artichokes/dip were delicious! This was a unique dish. The caprese salad and roasted carrots were also tasty. The artichoke dip was mostly cheese and very little artichoke or spinach.  The roasted carrots were warm and slightly sweet -soft but not mushy. 

Ambiance: Chill, seemingly like any other trendy chain place. 

This place was *packed* on a Tuesday night at 6-6:30pm.

First of all, let me proclaim that I was SHOCKED at how busy they were at 5:30 on a Monday night. They must be doing something right.

There was nothing particularly bad about our experience there, but then again, there was nothing that stood out either.  

Some of the highlights:
My friend had the Famous Grilled Chicken Salad and she was thoroughly delighted by the quality of the chicken.
The french fries that accompanied the burgers were thin-cut, crispy, not at all greasy and very tasty.
The squash soup was delicious.
They managed to cook my salmon on the rare side!

The low lights:
My husband's burger was cooked medium instead of medium rare.
They didn't serve bread before dinner, but I didn't bother to ask for it either.
They cleared plates before everyone was done (my pet peeve).
The waiter who brought my cocktail said ""You'll love this one . . . "" It was exactly the opposite for me; I hated it.
The mashed potatoes that accompanied my salmon were watery.
No one has any real enthusiasm, from the hostesses to our various servers . . . pretty dull.

The menu is Greco-American but not just gyros and fries. The salads are excellent- those with greens are ample and fresh and the pasta salad is incredible. The pasta salad is penne with a tangy dressing, with spring peas, feta and sun dried tomatoes. That combo really works- the peas are sweet to offset the bite of the tangy dressing and salty feta. A restaurant that pulls together a pasta salad with that much care for flavor, you know they do their grilled fare, pitas, sandwiches and pizzas right. 

The pita is overflowing with chicken, gyro meat, steak- your choice- tomatoes and zesty red onions and the pita itself is so good, you'll want an extra one to dip into the house made tzatziki sauce.

Our server was nice and smiled a lot but I have no idea what her name was and she had the personality of a beer coozy,  helpful but not necessary.

We asked our waiter if we could substitute chips and salsa ($5 bucks value) for a salad that we wouldn't even eat ($10 buck value).  The waiter just shook his head and gave some lame excuse about the computer not being able to do a switch and that we would have to get a salad, even if we weren't going to eat it.  We were disappointed that they could not even compromise at all and told the waiter to not even bring out our salads since we weren't going to eat them.  

Well, besides that small let down, the rest of the meal was very good. For our appetizer we got AZ egg rolls, which were really melt in your mouth good, served with some delicious dipping sauce.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"This was the second visit made to The White Chocolate Grill- allowing another chance for this popular and well-regarded restaurant to give me a reason to include it in the repertoire of eateries I frequent.

I wanted to like the place so much, the name just spoke to me with my love of all things white chocolate, but it seems I will have to find a way to convince myself to give them one more chance to redeem themselves...

I'll tell myself that this time I should cut them some slack because it was not only Valentine's Day, but our reservation was so late, at 9:30pm. I'll tell myself that this time I had a migraine and, yeah, we ordered with a few minor changes to accommodate our personal tastes and dietary / allergy needs... (Could she please substitute Monterey Jack for the Pepper Jack and please no mayo on the chicken sandwich... And could I please have either avocado or guacamole instead of the mayo on my burger? Which one? Guacamole, please. Thank you.)

Did we get seated fast after arriving early and there being more than a dozen people waiting for seating before us? Was both our hostess and server polite and perform professionally? Did the food arrive quickly and presented nicely? Was the atmosphere pleasant and tasteful? Was the food delicious? All these are ""Yes""

Was the food prepared correctly? Well, not entirely. The burger was served with avocado rather than the requested AND confirmed guacamole, however, it was also served with the dressing still on it. Minor and easy mistake really, but was really expecting ""perfection"" after seeing the ruthless corporate efficiency with which this restaurant is run during our short time there. Oh... and the fries (ugh- shoestring), while seemingly homemade, well, they left much to be desired- at least more than the messy scattering of limp, greasy potatoes that adorned our plates (sans the ketchup which one must order with their food- we did).

Am I being a tad harsh? Probably. The problem, though, is that my previous visit several years ago was marred by two pretty major issues... My mother chose to treat me to my birthday dinner at WCG- she arrived earlier than I did and was directed that she should sit in the bar area to wait for me. Mom sat directly at the bar top and when asked what she would like to drink, requested a margarita. Her bartender flitted away without further conversation and returned a few moments later with her beverage.

I arrived and joined her at the bar top, whereupon I asked what she was drinking, and she informed me a ""regular margarita, nothing special""... I inquired whether she had asked for something specific- be it by drink name or alcohol brand / variety- since I had also picked up the tab in front of her to pay it so we could move to a table for dinner and saw a check for nearly $20! She confirmed she had said nothing more than ""margarita"" and the bartender had not made any suggestions, let alone ask if she wanted something more than a simple ""well"" margarita. Nice way to take advantage of your guest, not to mention one who is a senior citizen.

After paying the tab, we had the hostess arrange a table for us and we were seated promptly. Dinner plans came to a screeching halt within minutes, sadly- I'm a vegetarian and there was nothing, save one salad, the chips & salsa appetizer, and dessert (at the time, not a one made with white chocolate, consequently...) on the menu for me to order. We inquired of our server whether there were any items on the menu which could be made vegetarian-safe and were told, after she had gone to the kitchen to verify, that the menu items I mentioned were the only ones available- others could NOT be modified (?)

Needless to say, we left and ended up having a nice meal at The Blue Agave Mexican restaurant in the same complex.

So, one star for the first visit, a generous four for the second visit- weighted average of three stars given. Let's hope the third time's a charm...",3,"[u' atmosphere pleasant', u' easy mistake', u' Nice way', u' nice meal']",2.366666667,"[u' so late', u' messy scattering']",-0.5

We both ended up ordering a fillet mine topped with blue cheese and his with Parmesan. How they cooked those fillets perfectly at medium rare and got them to the table piping hot is beyond me - but they did. The mashed potatoes or incredible, perfectly seasoned and the right consistency.

I have never had them prepared that way and if were ever in Scottsdale again will be back and I'll order the exact same items !  We couldn't resist the desert for two menu and chose the white chocolate banana cream pie. This wasn't like grandma or Marie calendars makes.   This was a crunchy graham cracker and chocolate chunk crust with fresh sliced bananas,  vanilla cream custard and whipped cream with Carmel sauce and shaved white chocolate .  My fiancé was thrilled that I was so full from dinner that I could only eat a few bites a dessert and he had to polish off the rest!  
The ambiance is casual but nice and romantic at the same time. The wood walls and dark ceiling with low lighting is so relaxing compared to those bright, sterile restaurants.

A few things that we've tried so far:

Fresh guacamole- served with warm tortilla chips and a side of salsa. The guacamole was definitely made fresh as you can tell from the taste and color. The tortilla chips are light and crisp and works very nicely with the creamy guacamole. We liked it so much we ordered this again. 

Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke Dip- served with warm tortilla chips. This is one of their more popular appetizers so I gave it try.  Maybe it was an off day when I ordered it, I found it very salty...probably won't order this again.

WCG Bacon Blue Cheese Salad- assorted mixed greens, blue cheese bits, bacon, candied nuts and red onion with a light vinagrette. I ordered this as a side salad and I was actually pleasantly surprised how great this tasted. Yum!

Fish of the day- Steelhead trout with herb sauce and fried shrimp with a side of vegetables.  I ordered this and was surprised that the trout tasted and looked a lot like salmon. The waiter mentioned that this particular trout had a similar lifestyle as it swam from the ocean to the river to spawn.  There was a creamy herbal sauce and a smattering of crispy fried shrimp on top.

Balsamic Ribeye - ribeye that is infused with balsamic vinegar and grilled. This was an item that one of the waiters recommended on our second visit. He recognized and welcomed us back again. This is a nice option for a twist on regular grilled steak. The balsamic vinegar has a nice tang and sweetness to it as it is caramelized over an open fire.

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA?select=tF2C4TMHcohGdMiZ3EEIcw#tRk182jI0MgeSm8WpHz4pg

Rotisserie Chicken Crepes - crepes filled with spinach and mushrooms & topped with Madeira sauce & parmesan cheese. I ordered this the 2nd time we went to WCG. It sounded interesting and I decided to give it a try. I would give it a 3 out of 5.  Maybe it was the parmesan cheese but the sauce was too salty for my liking. It wasn't so bad that I would send it back, but I probably wouldn't be inclined to order it again anytime soon.

Prime Rib-slow roasted with au jus. Delicious! They have prime rib after 4 pm and I think on holidays as I well. We went again on Father's Day and the waiter mentioned that they will be serving prime rib all day.

Save room as their desserts are quite good.

White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie- the banana cream was smooth and creamy and there were slices of banana and ribbons of white chocolate on top. However, the best part was the graham cracker and granola crust. Highly recommend this dessert!

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA?select=tF2C4TMHcohGdMiZ3EEIcw#vy0bhfeJMAHo4pfvpTZ_YA

White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake - the cheesecake was a generous piece and was drizzled with raspberry sauce and caramel sauce. This was probably one of the best cheesecake I've had in a while. It doesn't compare the cheesecake from the ""Cheesecake factory."" This cheesecake was silky smooth, creamy and surprisingly not very sweet. Highly recommend this dessert too! lol.

Freshly Baked Apple Pie a la mode- the waiter told us that this dessert takes about 10-15 minutes as they need to bake the crust and since we weren't in a hurry we waited. Sliced apples sprinkled with cinnamon filled a round flaky pastry and there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream and was drizzled with caramel sauce.  This was pretty good dessert if you like something similar to an apple tart.

Regarding the waitstaff Devin was great. He was attentive but not intrusive. However, on Father's day for lunch, another waiter who served us was less experienced and less attentive. It wasn't particularly busy that day either, maybe he was new and in training.  

My friend and I both ordered the balsamic ribeye on Father's Day. She ordered her's medium but when it came out, it was more like well done. We mentioned it to our waiter and he promptly brought it back to the kitchen. In about 10 minutes or so, I think it was the manager who brought the entree to my friend. He asked her to cut into the steak to make sure it was cooked properly and it was.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Went there last night for dinner because hubby had a gift card. It was quite a drive from where we live in Gilbert - the restaurant is near the 101 and Scottsdale Rd. The decor is very nice, with dark woods and booth seating - like many other reviewers it kind of reminded me of Houston's but not quite as stuffy. Their dining room is quite large and they have a large bar area as well. We only had to wait about 20 minutes on a Saturday night, but we were there pretty early too. Service level was just right - we were always attended to but didn't feel like we were being rushed.

Their menu had many great selections but hubby and I decided on their limited-menu ""Date Night Special"" for $29 per person. We split an artichoke dip appetizer, each got our own salads and entrees, and split dessert. 

Our salads were just OK - I had the blue cheese WCG salad which I thought would be more like the yummy wedge salads you can get at some places. It was more of a mixed green salad with vinaigrette dressing and sparingly-added bleu cheese and pecans.

 I was actually impressed at the many entree selections on their special menu. I decided on the bleu cheese filet and hubby got the crab cakes, each with mashed potatoes. We both thoroughly enjoyed our selections and ate every bite.

For our shared dessert we chose the white chocolate brownie which is their signature. It's a delicious hot blondie brownie with a few chocolate chips, topped with rich vanilla bean ice cream, chocolate syrup and a few shavings of white chocolate. YUM - it was so good even my husband (who's not big on sweets) ate as much as me. We were fighting for the last bite!

Overall food was very good and the value was excellent with this special. I do think we could have had a dinner just as nice closer to home so I doubt we will be back - it's not worth a special trip for us. Still, we were very happy and in fact stuffed when we left!

We had a table at 7, and even though we Happy Hour had passed, they still let us order off of the happy hour menu, so we had four courses for $30 a piece.  We started with Spinach Artichoke DIp, each had a salad (I had the Bacon/Bleu Cheese/Walnut - YUM), then I had the Balsamic Ribeye...  It was so delicious.  

One complaint, half of my steak was medium, a quarter was rare, and the other quarter was practically blue, but it still tasted great.  Oh - and the carrots were a little too sweet for me...  They tasted like sweet potatoes....

Anyway...  For dessert we had the bread pudding which was the best damned bread pudding I have ever had.  Add in the drinks (which were tasty) and our bill was still nothing too crazy.

Our server was just the right combination of hands off and hands on, and i dug her big time.  We ended up having a long leisurely meal, were there from 7-9, but it didn't feel like we were there a long time.  It was just a nice relaxing meal...

Our beloved White Chocolate Grill has, like so many other restaurants of its ilk, succumbed to cheaping-out on happy hour, overcharging for popular menu items, and now hosts a waiter whom if this was 1920's Alabama, I'd shoot him, barbecue him up, and feed him to local law enforcement officials at their annual picnic.

White Chocolate, I've been patiently waiting for this joyous time of year, the time when faux-Arizonans mass exodus to their cool summer abodes just like rats jumping off a sinking freighter. This is when I come knocking, so I can have you all to myself. And you pull this shit?

We're FUCKING through White Chocolate. (and this FUCKING has nothing on my wife's, which had nothing on mine). 

DISCLAIMER

1.) I had just finished watching Office Space before heading out for happy hour.
      Bill Lundbergh was everywhere.

2.) I wouldn't really shoot anyone like the girl in Fried Green Tomatoes. I would
     however give them a savage tongue lashing, and not the Michael Douglas kind.

3.) My balls are detachable in situations such as this.

4.) I wish I'd taken the Rodeo Clown career path. Being gored a few times would 
     beat this.

The drink menu is extensive and fun; I had the dragon berry lemonade. Then as a meal I had my usual scallops with couscous. The scallops were cooked perfectly with a delicious sauce. I loved the couscous; it was cold and had a different play on your average couscous but it was the good kind of different! I especially loved the added pistachios to the mix!

While we had an amazing dinner, I also need to applaud the service at White Chocolate Grill. From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, we were served by happy and helpful waitresses and hostesses. Anything we needed, they were there!

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Here comes the dreaded three star review. I hate writing 3 star reviews. They feel like teenage breakups... no, no, it's not you, it's me, I am just not satisfied. Sometimes the 3 star reviews are like nagging mothers... fine, mom, I don't want to cover my cleavage but I will do it for you.

Bottom line, I feel indifferent towards mediocre places. Three star reviews have nothing interesting to say. Who wants to go to an average place anyway? Don't we all want what's best and top notch? We are Americans after all. USA!! USA!! 

I digress. Let's get to the review.

Recipe for White Chocolate Grill:
1 scoop of Applebee's.
2 scoops of Outback
1/2 scoop of Pei Wei
2 scoops of other generic chain restaurants

Mix the above ingredients well, add a dash of good looking and professional staff, one semi-trendy looking bar area, and serve to patrons who do not know any better. There you go, you have it!

Okay food, everything we ordered was edible, nothing stood out. It's a safe bet when you do not want to venture out  or if you don't want to play all dress up for fancy food. It fulfills the need for a uninteresting but safe restaurant where everyone in the family, including that bratty screaming six year old (there are quite a few of them here), can get something to eat.

In the end, my mother-in-law was happy everyone in the family got something to eat. That's all that matters.

This is a usual Friday night date spot for me and my boo. Usually has a wait but we get lucky every time to find a seat at the bar to order a pre dinner cocktail. The lemon drops are tasty, the BF gets gin and tonics normally. He wishes they had a little more selection of gin..but no big deal. 

We like to go for the date night special where we can sample an app, salads, and a main meal for about $30 bucks a piece. We are not strict on how much we spend on meals so it just depends on what the main entrees there are offering at that time.

My typical eating style is big eyes, smaller stomach. I order way too much food but luckily, my man usually eats any left overs the next day. 

I am a big fan of the the artichoke dip with the salsa as an appetizer and I usually go straight for the ribs. They are damn good! I have also had a steak that is marinated in balsamic vinegar. The steak looked funky when they brought it out, I didn't say anything and they said they were already making me another steak to take home. OK! Steak and eggs for breakfast.

He took our orders and the food was served in a timely manner.  As is often the case, people from the kitchen brought out and served the meals.  Our waiter never came around until the meals were almost finished to see if everything was OK.  It was not.  Had he come around, I would have asked for Tabasco sauce, as well as bread.  By the time he asked, there was no need for the Tabasco sauce.  In terms of the bread, he said that it is brought only if asked for.  If that was the case, I think he should have asked if we wanted bread.  If it is the management's policy of not delivering bread unless asked for, the menu should have stated so.  Would we come back?  Sure.  Would we ask for Westmorland?  No.  If we were seated put at his station, we would not ask to be reseated.

Our entrees were the biggest disappointment. When I asked my waiter what was better, the classic chicken salad or the veggie burger, he said the latter. He wasn't convincing.  I asked about the minted green beans, he responded ""they're not my favorite, but I eat them all the time.""  Okay...points for honesty.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"This place is on our usual restaurant rotation.  Nice rich woods and modern decor, dimly lit with spot lighting on tables and such....great patio seating with outdoor fireplace. The patio does face busy Scottsdale Rd, but they did a good job of blocking it in.  There's nothing better than sitting outside in Scottsdale when it's nice out.   If you have never been here before, you may mistake this place for a Houston's knockoff (overall feel of restaurant, lighting, menu....) I swore up and down they were sister restaurants, but indeed, they are not.  I still prefer Houston's quality of food/serfvice better, BUT, when it comes to menu selection, price points, ability to make reservations, and THE DESSERTS...WCG wins.  

I guess I will start with dessert.
OH my...the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie....
This is soooooo YUMMMM! It can feed at the least 2 people.  It isn'y your 'typical' pie crust...Graham cracker crust filled with fresh bananas and pudding/filling, fesh whipped cream and copious amounts of shaved white chocolate curls....I love it because it isn't overly sweet and heavy.  Which I'm sure is misleading because the graham cracker crust probably has a nice amount of butter in it....MMMMMMMmmmm!

Their dinner for two (should be dinner for 3-4) special is a really great deal under $30 pp will get you 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 1 dessert. 
*note...banana cream pie not available for dessert....BOO
 
The prime rib is delicious! Juicy, tender, nice flavorful crust. good jus.  They serve it with the horseradish, but I've had better, stonger hoseradish elsewhere...but still great! Definitely a good value and worth ordering.

Ribs are delish as well.  Good flavor...Is it super fall off the bone like Houston's ribs? Not quite, but still very good! These are definitely shareable. 

Burgers are good too...

Don't bother ordering the chicken tortilla soup.  It's edible, but it is seriously heavy and not what comes to mind when I want a tortilla soup.  It should be called a chicken enchilada soup. That is EXACTLY what it tastes like, an enchilada. Not bad tasting....just not a tortilla soup. 

Crab cakes....MEH....Blah. Good flavor, but cookie cutter, (canned?)  crabcakes. Kind of expected from the price point....lots of filler.  Of course, I am spoiled by Ruth's Chris CRAB cakes, so this may be a bit harsh.  I don't want my crab to look like  canned tuna mince! 

The artichoke dip is good too...especially to  munch on at the bar. Nicley backdropped by backlit alcohol bottles arranged by rows and flat screen tvs. Comes with a ton of chips and the salsa it comes with is soo tasty and fresh.  Could totally come from a mexican restaurant. 

Make reservations if you don't want to wait...at least a 40 minute wait w/o them...EVEN ON WEEKDAYS! At least there is a nice outdoor seating area complete with yet another fireplace and someone to come by every so often to offer drinks. No waiting at the bar/bar tables, but they fill up quick b/c they do offer a selective happy hour menu. 

Over the course of our many visits, we have only had one not so great experience there while having lunch at the bar tables.  I think the gal was new, but we have come back since, and everything was great!

-- silky chocolate soufflé cake: did not try, but got a feeling this one was the least popular of the trio 
-- white chocolate banana creme pie: this was my pick because...bananas & white chocolate *insert girl motioning ""duh"" emoji* Large white chocolate shavings were a dessert all on their own. Pastry creme & whipped cream melted quickly, & caramel was overwhelming. 
-- white chocolate raspberry cheesecake: again, overloaded with caramel sauce & whipped cream. Soft, overly sweet, but plenty of raspberry flavor.

Overall, we had the same impression as we have had in the past--it is okay but not a place to rush back to any time soon.  We took advantage of the date night special, a summer menu others have mentioned in previous reviews.  For the shared appetizer, we ordered the AZ eggrolls that were chewing and just not good.  To the credit of the restaurant they did take this off the bill without even being asked.  The salads were typical (green and Cesar were ordered). The entrees were very good, fillet and pork tenderloin.  One of the best parts of the meal was the couscous.  Very good and not typical of sides you order at other restaurants. We both thoroughly enjoyed this dish.  Our shared dessert was the bread pudding. Okay, but a bit too sweet for my liking. I still think Phoenix City Grille has the best bread pudding in town.  The biggest issue with this restaurant is around service.  I felt rushed. Salads were delivered less than 5 minutes after the appetizer.  The wait staff hoovered.

I have to say that this place serves one of the BEST Pork Tenderloins I have ever eaten.  The meat is so tender you could cut it with a fork and it came with a very complimentary apricot glaze and mashed potatoes.

Although, again, if I could rate them differently for their dessert, they would have received possibly 4 stars. It might be a place where a few cocktails over dessert could be quite appealing.

I almost don't want to give 5 stars, just because they're a chain, but after my experience there tonight, I feel they deserve an all-star rating!

I arrived first (as usual) and put our name in (party of 4)... it was prime time (7:30 on a Friday night), so I expected a wait.  (They don't take reservations during dinner; only lunch).  I was given a beeper thing, and no more than 5 minutes later, it vibrated.  The rest of my party was not even there yet!  The hostess sat me anyways - there was a great table available in the bar area.  

Alicia was our server and approached me within minutes of sitting down to take my drink order.  I also ordered the artichoke appetizer for the table.  The rest of my party arrived and Alicia was back to take their drink orders. share the specials, answer questions, etc...

3 of us ordered the crab cake entree (2 with a side of broccoli and 1 with a side of honey roasted carrots) - and my dad had the halibut with fries... everything was delicious!  The crab cakes are not breaded at all; they melt in your mouth!  The broccoli is steamed just right and sprinkled with parmesan and some special seasoning that makes it taste great.  The carrots are sweet like candy.  I didn't have any, but the fries that came with the fish looked good too!

In the past, I've also had the Four Cheese Spinach & Artichoke Dip (served with warm tortilla chips and salsa), the Rotisserie Chicken Tortilla Soup, and several salads... I've always been impressed with the quality, taste, and serving sizes too!

I didn't tonight, but if you can - save room for dessert!  The desserts are actually listed at the top of the menu, so they stand-out - for good reason!  They are all phenomenal!  My favorites are the White Chocolate Brownie, the White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie with Graham Cracker Crust, and the apple pie a la mode!

Yes, the menu is similar to Houston's; yes, the bar is a replica of Ocean Club... but, the service and quality of WCG make this place unique and worth every bit of the 5 star rating I'm giving them!

We each had the pyramid hefeweisen and the chips and guacamole, which were very good.  The waiter noticed that we ran low on chips and brought us more without us having to ask. I the seared ahi tuna appetizer as my entree.  It was perfectly cooked, and the portion was so large it was definitely enough for an entree.

Sat outside in the patio area where it is a lot easier to talk than in the main restaurant.  Since it's mid-November it was a little chilly but with the heaters on it was not a problem.  My girlfriend had the blackened fish sandwich which she said was ""outstanding"". Also tried the grilled salmon and Cajun chicken sandwich which were both ""excellent"" choices.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"After having written the review below we received a message from the restaurant stating that they were very sorry for our poor service and wanted to send us some gift certificates so that we would return and hope we would have a better experience. After having received 2-$25 gift certificates we returned on a Friday for lunch and sat in the bar area. The service was wildly better versus our dinner experiences. We ordered beverages and then two of us proceeded to change seating positions. The server remembered who had what and gave us each the right beverage. That was an impressive moment. We all ordered soup and or salads and were very pleased with both the flavor and quantity for the price. The wedge salad was very substantial and a Caesar salad served as part of the soup and salad combo was enormous. Both had very flavorful dressings as others have mentioned. 

We will return again in the future to try some of their sandwiches at lunchtime.

---------------------------

We ate here on Sunday and then again on Thursday with different couples. See attached receipts.

The food is very, very good here. The service however needs a lot of work. Our first server on Sunday, Maxwell, had an almost snarky attitude. He definitely sounded and looked like he did not want to be there. When the server has a almost condescending, nasty tone in their voice you know that something is wrong either with that person or management.

Thursday we had dinner and were quickly seated at our table and approached by our server Ryan. He seemed very nice and we told him we needed a few minutes because we had not seen each other in a very long time and we were going to be chatting for a few minutes. When we did finally order he almost looked like a deer in the headlights when answering questions about the menu and listening to my request for extra crushed red pepper for my jambalaya which he said was not spicy.

After he left we realized we wanted to order bread, so it took at least seven or eight minutes to snare him and ask him to bring some. Another 10 to 15 minutes went by and lo and behold our dinner is being served and the bread has not yet arrived. We asked the server who was dropping off the entrées and he said with a not so nice attitude ""that is baked to order, so it takes a little while"", to which I responded that we ordered it quite some time ago.

About five minutes later the same server came back and said the bread was on its way. Our server Ryan finally showed up to see if everything was okay and I reminded him that I had requested crushed red pepper when I had placed my order, to which he looked at me with wide eyes and then ran away to go get it, and that return trip took at least three or four more minutes again.

In the meantime while we were waiting for the bread, that didn't arrive until after our entrées were served, Ryan had asked if anyone wanted another drink and one of us asked for a second beer. That beer did not arrive until we were almost done eating our entrées easily 15 minutes after the order for that drink had been taken.

Then we ordered dessert. You're not gonna believe what happened next, the bill came before the desserts were even served. Clearly unacceptable we took the check and put it by the salt-and-pepper shakers and did not look at it until we were good and ready to pay the bill.

We know this place has good food and reasonable prices but the service needs work and trying to herd you out of there like cattle is unacceptable. Management needs to work on these aspects especially with these two servers.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"While in Scottsdale recently we got hungry. We happened to drive by a little shopping center that had a bunch of places to eat and one was the White Chocolate Grille. We looked up their menu on our iphone and it looked good so we decided to give it a shot. 

While waiting for our table we heard a couple leave saying ""delicious!"" and ""that was SO good!"" so we had our hopes pretty high. Once we were seated our drinks were refilled quickly and frequently and our order came out in about 10-15 minutes which I thought was pretty good for how busy it was (a Friday night). 

The only downside to our meal was that I received the wrong sandwhich and it took another 10-15 minutes to get the correct one and by now my wife was almost done with her meal.

When the correct sandwhich finally came, holy smokes it was good.  If we're ever in Scottsdale again or if we ever see another White Chocolate Grille we'll 100% eat there again. 

For dessert we decide to try the first thing on the menu, the white chocolate brownie. It was good but nothing amazing. Personally I felt there was too much brownie and chocolate sauce and not enough ice cream and whip cream to balance it out. In the future I'd definitely eat there again but I'd probably just go someplace else for dessert.",4,"[u' SO good', u' pretty high', u' pretty good']",1.38,"[u' little shopping', u' wrong sandwhich']",-0.6875
UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Oh dear God, people should NOT compare this to CPK or Cheesecake Factory. Yeah, okay, it's themed around white chocolate. Does that make it bad? No. WCG serves decent food in a nice atmosphere that doesn't give off the mass produced feel of those other places.

And just to clear things up, only the desserts incorporate the namesake ingredient. You won't be seeing any white chocolate shavings on your filet. 

Last night we had the chicken madeira, the blackened fish sandwich, and a chicken caesar salad. For dessert we tried the white chocolate raspberry cheesecake. Overall everything was pretty good. The chicken and fish were cooked perfectly. The madeira sauce on the chicken was thick with mushrooms. 

The mashed potatoes were different. They have a hint of nutmeg or cinnamon, and the gravy is more of jus with peppery flavor. I liked it, but my brother didn't.

The cheesecake was good. Not the best, but good. The graham cracker crust and white chocolate shavings made it. Coulda used more raspberry.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Made reservations to celebrate our anniversary.  Check in went smoothly and on time, as it was a busy Saturday evening.  We sat for a while without being greeted by our server and then when she showed up she let us know that she was very good at what she does - btw...she is very mistaken...oh right...and happy anniversary (the only thing that happened for the event) not sure why they ask. (small token chocolate??)

She brought our drinks, took our order and that was about the last time we saw her.  Someone else brought the mediocre food, set it down and left.  My husband has entertained business guests a number of times and has been served an assortment of bread which either isn't done anymore or was left out.  We asked someone as they went by if we could have bread, he said it would take five minutes - wow!!  Two rolls came out on a plate that were hard as a rock and cold - microwaved for sure.  He ordered salmon, which was good, but the broccoli was cold.  I ordered chopped chicken salad which was drenched in dressing and I left half behind. Not once were we asked how are meal was by anyone.  

Our glasses sat empty and we were never asked if we would like anything more to drink.  I finally asked for another club soda with lime and I was brought a glass of warm soda water, no ice or lime.  I asked if I could have ice, and she brought a cup of ice. Guess I have to combine the two!!

She did drop the check off and someone else finally picked it up to process it.  After much time, we had to flag her down - ""oh, did I not bring it back to you?""  Nope...that's why we are still sitting here!!

Needless to say, she was the worst server we have ever had (and we eat out a fair bit).  What was suppose to be a really pleasant anniversary dinner, turned into an irritating disappointment of an experience.

Sure, the ambiance is nice, the servers are awesome, and the location is great as it is located on the brink of north Scottsdale, but the highlight of my most recent visit was sinking my chompers into a juicy, fall-off-the-bone rack of baby back ribs with fresh mashed potatoes and french fries to compliment (I'm all about potatoes, but different sides may be chosen). I'm crazy about this place alright; I'd even be crazy enough to say that the artichoke dip beats Oregano's Boom Dip as it does not have any oil or grease - ftw!

My only other thoughts: 1) Why isn't there more white chocolate on the menu? 2) There was no puff to my chocolate souffle, which would've made worlds of a difference as souffle loosely translates into ""puff up"".

Last night we are here for my boyfriend's birthday dinner. Ashley was our server and she was very lovely! What gets me is the staff is very knowledgable about the food and able to describe everything. She was great! We ordered everything they had on special last night. We decided on the silky gluten free chocolate soufflé for dessert. I felt it was good, but super dry and crumbly. Thinking it was just supposed to be like this and I just didn't like it, I ignored it. Ashley came by and asked how we liked it. After telling her it was a bit dry she offered something else. We declined as we had eaten some of the dessert already. A few mins later a manager came over with a fresh one and stuck around while we tried it. It was completely different and moist! Delicious! She comped it for us. It just happened that we got a bad one. 
This place really cares about your experience. Highly recommended and we'll be back! Thanks Ashley and manager (sorry we forgot your name!)",5,"[u' amazing service', u' fine dining', u' free chocolate']",1.416666667,[u' bad one'],-0.7

The interior is dinner appropriate with dark woods and colors plus dim lighting. I wouldn't dine here during the day though. It would put me to sleep after a big meal.

Our waitress was very nice and gave good suggestions.

We started with the Caprese Salad which was tasty. But something wasn't timed correctly in the kitchen and our entrees arrived 3 minutes later. We would up taking 1/2 of the appetizer home.

I was in the mood for something different. In past trips I ate the crab cakes which are good. This time I got their Rotisserie Chicken Crepes. The crepes were filled with spinach and mushrooms & topped with Madeira sauce & parmesan cheese. The spinach was so finely chopped I didn't taste it. It was good.

The server was very sweet but lacked professionalism and experience. 

I ordered the Dragonberry Lemonade and the server had to come back and tell me they were out of the Dragonberry rum. I picked another drink - but... I have to say, I work for 8 restaurants in food and beverage at a resort and in no way do I think it's acceptable to run out of an ingredient for a cocktail featured on the menu. 

We ordered our entrees, my boyfriend the filet and myself the prime rib. The server tried to suggest adding mushrooms to his filet but couldn't tell us what kind of mushrooms they were and instead settled for drawing us a picture of what the mushroom looked like. 10 minutes after we ordered the server came back and told me they were out of the prime rib. It DOES say ""limited availability"" on the menu and I understand this is an easy item to run out of but I think a server should know this prior to taking an order at the table. I opted to have the balsamic ribeye instead. 

When our food arrived everything was cooked perfectly but we both found everything to be over seasoned. The balsamic ribeye was delicious but the flavor was too intense for an entire steak. I could only eat a couple bites because it was so rich. 

For dessert we had the brownie which the server said was the best which we thought was just mediocre.

Went for lunch yesterday and was not so pleased, here's why:

Our server was not on top of things, he did not fully explain the special, only noticed this when I overheard another waitress describing it.

I ordered the Blackened fish sandwich(mahi-mahi) (see pics) I chose to have the Vegetable of the day which he told me was roasted spaghetti squash.  The fish itself was very good, the sauce however had a weird herb or spice that just didn't sit right with me and the squash was riddled with raisins and pistachios (that would have been nice to know beforehand) it was also barely warm. 

My husband ordered the Balsamic Rib-eye with mashed potatoes (see pics) I tasted it it had a great flavor and he loved it! The mashed potatoes however were lukewarm at best.......sigh........
I ate the tomatoes that came on his plate and they were the best part of the meal, so sweet and juicy drizzled with balsamic Yum!

We  Finally got a refill on our soda when we had only a few bites of food left! Our little waiter was too busy pretending to be cool holding up the bar.

It was little while before someone came over and take our drink order, however this person was just helping out. She took our drink order and told us who our server was going to be. This is when the really long wait started. It was about 8 minutes before our server showed up. That's quite a while when the menus are closed!  We figured he was on a smoke break and when he showed up, clearly he had been! 

We started out with fresh guacamole and salsa. Nice fresh warm chips. Pretty good all around!

For my entree I had the filet mignon Cobb salad, substituting ranch dressing for the red wine vinaigrette. My salad arrived and it looked beautiful but I had two complaints about it. The filet mignon was more like overcooked steak cubes and there was way too much blue cheese. I love blue cheese but this was excessive and overpowered the flavor of the salad completely. 

My friends seemed to enjoy their bun-less cheeseburger and famous chicken salad entrees. No complaints from them.

I came here with 2 co-workers after a day at the office.  None of us live in Phoenix so we found this place through Yelp and loved the name.  Plus it got good reviews.

The interior of this restaurant looks very expensive.  Darker woods, an expansive bar, an open kitchen.   It's very clean and crisp and you feel as if you may be sitting in an exclusive steak house.

The menu is wonderful!  Tons of fresh soups, salads, sandwiches, and entree's to choose from.  I love this fresh, upscale American dining experience and The White Chocolate Grill nails it.   The prices are unbelievably reasonable for where you are and what you are getting.  I got the rotisserie chicken because they described it on the menu with ""really good gravy"".  Again, great marketing because we all know that really good gravy can make your whole meal.  

It was wonderful.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and tender and juicy, and the gravy was, in fact, really good.   I also had a few bites of the chicken tortilla soup and loved every slurp.

I was too full to order dessert which kind of upset me because I was looking forward to trying the white chocolate banana cream pie.

Now, it's not that WCG wasn't worthy of a review, it's just I normally don't write reviews for chain restaurants, but I am making an exception because I REALLY like their food and service. 

So, my favorite things to get here are their salads. I've had most of them besides the Tuna one and each one is fresh with quality ingredients that alone are standouts. The cajun chicken sandwich is amazing as are the crepes. The desserts are great- I judge a dessert on whether or not it is served warm (if it should be) and this place passes the test with flying colors. 

The service is great- in fact one time we got a free dessert because dinner took ""too long"" to get to us- the thing was we didn't even complain, nor did we think it was taking long... of course I will take a free dessert though!

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Today was my fourth visit to WCG (twice for lunch, twice for dinner).  I've never been disappointed in anything I've ordered there.  My favorite lunch was the tuna burger that they offered as a lunch special--a patty of tuna grilled like a hamburger, only it was still nice and pink on the inside.  It was served with a wasabi sauce that made it scruptious.

Tonight for dinner I had the 6.5 oz filet mignon, and it was absolutely perfect--medium rare, melt-in-your-mouth tender and perfectly seasoned.  My hubby had the ribs and raved about them (he also brought half of them home since it's a large rack.)

I have two favorite dishes that I MUST have at WCG each time I visit.  The first is the Israeli couscous.  It's a delicious side dish of pearly Israeli couscous mixed with golden raisins, pistachios, chopped herbs, in a creamy flavorful (curry?) sauce.  It's amazing!

The second dish is their white chocolate bread pudding.  It's a large portion, enough to feed several people, and it's so rich and decadent.  It comes with real whipped cream, and has a scrumptious white sauce.  Superb!

Service at WCG is generally attentive and prompt.  The decor is upscale with lots of dark mahogany wood, mood lighting, booths and tables.  The bar area is very cool with a lighted display of various liquor bottles.  The entrance to the restaurant features a seating area with a fireplace that comes in handy on the few cool evenings that we have here in AZ.

Not exactly what I had in mind for lunch with mom, but whatever ... I was ready for anything.

Still, I never did quite get my bearings in this place. Service was rushed and the food wasn't really that great. I can't turn down an Ahi Tuna Salad, which is what I ordered here, but the dressing was overpowering, even after I sent the salad back asking for less of the creamy stuff. So that wasn't good, but even more disappointing was the tuna, which really had no flavor. Oh, and the server never did return to ask how everything tasted.

Walking in, I noticed the  oustide of the place was modern and lemmie tell ya, I like modern.  Well lets say modernish...yeah.  Before we took the plunge inside, I decided to read the gilded framed menu suspended next to the entry door;  while I was reading at least 2 different blue hairs going in had to stop and tell me how FABULOUS the food was .  Hook , line and sinker.  I mean, if you can't believe the old farts, who can you believe?

This place is kinda dark inside. Not deliverance or deer hunter dark, but ""I need a night light"" sorta dark.  I agree with the other yelper, this place is a nap-danger for adults.  Soup should be served sparingly inside to prevent table drownings.  It was rather nice inside though, I liked it.. just dark.  The booth was nice and squishy too, just the way i like em'.

I had the 6 oz filet, and my dahlin' had the crab cakes.  Both were quite tasty, but my mashed 'taters were kinda sub par considering the price tag. (why are masheds so ignored?? WHY??)  Granted we orderd off the date menu, a fixed price bastard that let us choose 1 app, 2 salads, 2 entrees, and 1 dessert to share.  I'd bore the crap outta you if I went into details about every course, but they were all good in a passable kinda way.  I'm writing this review aren't I?

Irony upon irony, the desserts you could pick from on said ""date"" menu, even though ALL desserts are listed at the same price, did not include the white chocolate cheese cake.  Black flagged again.  I even tried to substitute and the staunchly refused.  I will get even with them I swear.

We ordered the scallops and Alaskan halibut, both dishes were cooked and flavored well. The side dishes were a bit of a problem though.

Their french fries have so much potential, they were shoestring and cooked perfectly, but had almost no seasoning. All they need to do is throw a little seasoning on those puppies and they would be fantastic. 

Service and management were really great. They gave us a free dessert (GF souffle) because we had a little incident with another patron.

Maytag Burger - WCG grinds all their meat in-house, and this juicy delight is just right!  Each bite is infused with Iowa blue cheese and applewood smoked bacon, and these flavors enhance rather than overpower the beef.  Mmmm... Beef!

I ordered the homemade guac.

The White Chocolate Grill is a staple of the North Scottsdale area.  When I'm in need a spot to hit up for some good eats this is probably my pick for a sure bet.

I came here many a times, but usually ordering burgers and steak.  This time around I went for a salad and a fish dish.  My partner and I ordered the Kale & Spinach Salad with goat cheese and raisins added and for the fish entree we shot for the Blackened Mahi.  Overall, I'm glad we added the goat cheese adding an extra sweet but creamy texture to the salad.  The salad originally came with chicken, strawberries, carrots, candied nuts and tossed in a Asian honey vinaigrette.  Overall, a solid salad of crunchy bites and a fresh start to our meal.  Our entree was cooked to perfection with a creamy Creole sauce and crab meat.  The fish itself was moist and meaty.

Service here is always stellar and on point.  We sat at the bar enjoying the view of the game and a beautifully display of drinks.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"What a dinner.

I picked this place because it was very close to my house, and the reviews on Yelp were relatively good. I am only disappointed that I didn't try it sooner. The wait staff, hostesses, runners and bartenders were friendly, courteous and quick to smile; everybody seemed genuinely eager and happy to take care of the guest's needs. The ambiance is trendy casual without crossing the line to pretentious. The lighting is warm and inviting but low enough to still provide an intimate feel, and the dark woods used throughout the restaurant help lend a subtle sophistication to the atmosphere.

The menu is quite large and can be almost overwhelming, with entrees ranging from salads and sandwiches to burgers and steaks. My date and I decided to start out with an appetizer and, although the guacamole and chilled cheese with chip special sounded good, opted for their shrimp cocktail.

The shrimp were perfectly cooked and served with a cocktail sauce and a mayonnaise-based jalapeño sauce. The cocktail sauce was really horseradish heavy, which we both loved, and really tangy. The mayo sauce seemed odd, as I thought it was tartar sauce, but turned out to be a very good, subtle accompaniment to the shrimp. It was so good, in fact, we were dipping our forks into it and taking bites of the lettuce garnish from the plate. The staff also added an extra shrimp (the menu said seven were served) because there were two of us sharing.

For dinner I chose the bleu cheese crusted tenderloin, rare, with broccoli as a side. The steak was cooked right on the border of bleu, which is how I think a rare steak should be served. The bleu cheese was slightly melted over the top of the steak, forming a cap, and then either brûléed or browned under a salamander. The meat was tender, moist, well seared, and more flavorful than most tenderloins I've had. The broccoli was also very well cooked, sitting in that zone right between crunchy and soft, and very well seasoned.

My date had the Ono in a light citrus bur blanc and honeyed carrots. The fish was wood grilled perfectly and the sauce added a bit of needed fat and acid without overpowering the subtle flavor of the fish. The honeyed carrots... Wow; the carrots were fantastic.

For dessert, two caramel lattes and the gluten free chocolate soufflé cake. The coffees were stellar, and the texture of the cake had me doubting it was gluten free. The chocolate was extremely rich, still warm, and the cool creme anglaise was a delicious counterpoint to the dark, earthy chocolate.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"This is absolutely our favorite restaurant of any restaurant we've ever been to. I cannot understand why they don't have a 5-star rating. Maybe the prices? Well, the food is worth it. Maybe the lack luster desserts? OK, I get that.

But, we usually don't eat dessert in a restaurant, so we could care less if they suck. 

The main food and appetizers, however, the absolute best. I wish we could afford to eat here more often, but in the real world we don't all make millions. However, when we want to go out for a good meal, we love to go here. Had the BBQ platter and I wasn't expecting it to be great, but I was craving BBQ. It was some of the best BBQ I've had and I was blown away surprised. 

My wife had the jambalaya. It comes with huge shrimp and she's a very ""plain"" kind of eater. She orders cheeseburgers with just cheese and ketchup. She eats spaghetti with just noodles and sauce. Her salads are lettuce and dressing. However, she LOVES the jambalaya. 

Also had the prime rib and, to your amazement, they actually made it a medium rare! I usually order medium rare knowing they'll make it a medium. I like medium rare as well, but they usually make it rare. I took a chance and WCG delivered.

Everything else was great. I'm not impressed by their desserts, and I suggest you steer clear of the apple pie, you won't like it. It's not a slice of apple pie like you'd think.

The waitress forgot to bring my daughter her soda, then when she finally did bring it, it tasted watered down and flat. You would think that when restaurants charge $3 for a soda, it should at least be good. The waitress was not surprised the soda was bad; like she expected it to be. All of our carrots were cold and we told the waitress, so she brought us ONE order of hot carrots for the FOUR of us to share. My daughter ordered the center cut and it was TINY.

When they first brought out the food our younger son remarked how STUPID all the dishes looked except for the ribs (which I think are now about $26. Up for just under $20. Last year) because there was WAY more EMPTY space on the plate than food. This place has downsized their portions incredibly but are too cheap to buy new smaller plates. No one had leftovers except for the cold carrots we took to go. I can't understand how restaurants think it's ok to jack up their prices to $30 per dish and cut back so much on the portions.

A positive, however, is that we did get a side of mashed potatoes with the veggie burger which was very good and is an item not offered at Houston's.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"I guess it's time to update this review after my most recent experience. I'm not a complicated diner, neither is my wife, but for some reason at White Chocolate Grill, at least this particular location, getting the orders right has always been a problem. On my last visit, that problem was escalated by their jerk of a general manager and that's where I drew the line and decided to never go back.

So what happened? My wife orders the chicken sandwich, with only lettuce and tomato. Pretty simple right? Unfortunately not. As had become painfully commonplace at this location, the sandwich shows up wrong. There is cheese on it, which my wife absolutely detests. I sent it back immediately with the food runner, as our server was (of course) not present when the food came out. The server showed up minutes later to find me starring at my own food as it got cold, while my wife had no plate at all. When he inquired what happened, I unloaded and told him that for what was probably the fourth time, they'd botched a simple request to get us a plain sandwich with just lettuce and tomato. It's always something, either the cheese or they leave everything on it, you name it, they've done it. He tells me he'll send the manager over.

The manager indeed came over, corrected sandwich in hand, about 2 minutes later. After dropping it on the table and following a contrite, absolutely insincere apology he attempted to slink off before I could say anything. I stopped him and asked why this continues to be a problem, why it is so difficult at this restaurant but no other I've ever been to, to get a simple order correct. The manager starts his tirade with the words,'I don't want to argue with you, sir, but ...' and then launches into this ridiculous explanation about how it's actually our fault for ordering it wrong. In his world a chicken sandwich is like a cheeseburger, and when you order it plain, it still comes with cheese. I pointed out that this made no sense, since it isn't a cheese-sandwich and there's no expectation that it should come with cheese when ordered plain or 'only with', etc. He shrugged it off, argued further that cheese is on the meat and the lettuce, tomato, onion and may is on the other side with the bun, so therefore, somehow, cheese is not a condiment like all the rest so it made sense to include cheese when we asked for lettuce and tomato only.

No, I am not making this stuff up, but that is absolutely what he said. When I asked him how to correct the problem on future visits, given his outlook on how we're too stupid to order properly, he said, no lie, ""You need to tell the server you want to order a chicken sandwich, plain, then specify no cheese, then ask them to add lettuce and tomato."" I almost fell out of the chair. My wife and I just stared at him blankly, said ""O...K...."" and with that he made another insincere, ""Well, sorry,"" and off he went.

And no, for the record, he did not comp us on any part of the meal, not even in part. The server had the nerve to ask if we were going to order dessert as well and showed us the menu. No it was not an offer of a free dessert for the trouble, it was an up-sell, apparently. Wow.

My wife and I left a $1 tip and a note for the server to get the rest of his tip from the manager that had the sheer nerve to argue with a customer. I complained directly to the corporate office in Scottsdale and, believe it or not, the general manager even argued with the customer relations person. His explanation for his actions, when she followed up with him? ""We get people complaining if we ask too many questions, like whether or not they also want the cheese."" Really? You have got to be kidding me! I have never in my life seen someone tell a server that they asked too many questions. Is that the best line he could come up with?

Given that the manager argues with corporate rather than apologize, I have absolutely no intention of ever bringing my business back to this place. Mind you, I've been going to this location for over a year and have taken numerous people with me, including family, friends and coworkers, heck I even arranged a 20 person party on their patio at one point. This experience cost them a lot of business by treating us this way, and I've made sure to tell as many people about my experience as possible since I work nearby.

Wait staff is always excellent and attentive.  We always order the same meal.  Mine is Salmon (perfectly grilled salmon)... Hubby is French dip sandwich with fries. 
I order a 1/2 salad this time and broccoli ...al dente' which I have to explain to the watiress is just barely cooked and crisp (after a blank stare when I say Al dente').
Dinner is served...............no salad, and the broccoli is overcooked and mushy, with way too much seasoning and not acceptable.  Salmon is getting smaller and smaller each visit as is hubby's sandwich which is the incredible shrinking machine, along with miniscule fries that used to be heaping!!
Hello waitress.............the broccoli is not acceptable and with apologies, another order of broccoli appears by another server we have never seen before.  The difference in what was served with the fish and the plate brought out is huge!!  I ask to see the manager because the difference is worth noting.   She agrees with our issues and apologizes as well as agreeing it was not up to standards.
We finish our meal and the waitress approaches and acknowledges our anniversary and offers a desert.  We refuse as we were not planning on having desert and were full.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Once again another ""this place is awesome"" word of mouth place in Scottsdale that let me down.  I had been hearing about this place for awhile but its kind of far so when I saw the groupon for WCG, it was the push I needed to head north.  

Things that went wrong:
- I didn't know it was a must have reservations kind of place, but it is.  Thats fine though- you live and you learn, but the way the hostess handled it was the problem.  She was very rude, took our name and gave us the vibrator thing.  After sitting for 30ish minutes we heard another host tell people coming in that they could sit in the bar area or the patio instead of waiting.  Would of been nice to know when we came in!

-I don't like the fact that you have to ask for bread.  If a restaurant is gonna have bread it should just be automatically taken to the table.  It makes you feel like a fatty, cheap ass wanting free food when you have to ask. 

-I got the chicken crepes. The madeira sauce was just a dark gravy, it just wasn't my thing so I can't blame them for me making a bad choice.  What I was mad about was the broccoli.  I've had better broccoli from a school food service buffet line!  The broccoli was so overcooked that it turned to mush when you touched it with a fork.  AWFUL!  Should NOT happen at a nice restaurant.

Things that were good:
-The server
-My bf said the ribs were good.  I didn't try.
-The white chocolate blonde brownie was amazing.  It is the only thing that is making me choose 3 stars rather than 2.

It seemed like a lot of business lunch and early retirees.  All the servers helped to fill drinks which I thought was great because most restaurants have servers who are snippy/greedy about their tips and only care to serve their own tables/needs.  The teamwork here really helped to elevate the service.

Great decor, not too dark but dark enough to create the right ambiance for this upscale American food.  Healthy comfort food.  The appetizer special was the double dip which came with freshly fried tortilla chips and jalapeno queso dip/salsa/guacamole.  Great portion.  Good dips! 

For Entree it was the Filet mignon Cobb Salad for her, and the Spinach Kale salad for me.  House made dressings really make a salad and theirs were on point.  The filet cobb had a bite from the intense bleu cheese they put on the plate but combined with the steak and their red wine vinaigrette with marinated mushrooms, it was so good!

The tanginess from the asian dressing on the kale salad worked well with their strawberries and sesame seeds.  I believe the kale was either quickly blanched or massaged into submission to lend it's mellow and comforting texture.  This is crucial for a kale salad otherwise you'll be looking like a dinosaur trying to conquer those big leaves.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Weekend plans prevented me from kicking off AZ Restaurant Week on Saturday. So on Monday, Venyse and I headed to White Chocolate Grill where we both had our cherries popped.

We started out with the spinach artichoke dip. The blends of cheeses made this perhaps the single most spectacular dip I've ever had the honor of putting in my mouth. O.M.G. Venyse and I were practically clawing at the bowl to get the last of its creamy loveliness. But when you hit a home run so soon in the game, the rest of a meal can seem at odds.

However, I was not daunted. She ordered the New York Strip with a side of mashed potatoes (with good gravy...what exactly is that?) and roasted carrots; I the blackened Mahi [*back story to follow] topped with crab and a side of Israeli couscous. We didn't share our protein, but we sampled each others sides. All were very good, but the carrots really stood out. The gravy and the potatoes were good and I loved my couscous. But halfway through here steak and by the last few bites of my fish, we both hit the wall. A food coma was certain. I persevered but Venyse relented and boxed the rest of her meat and carrots.

Then came the white chocolate brownie. So sweet, so rich, so topped with vanilla ice cream. It was all we could to to make a dent in it. We both felt bad, because isn't white chocolate supposed to be their signature ingredient? 

Regardless, this was a terrific first restaurant to go with which to begin. And we both agreed it would be a place in our future dinner splurges. I also must admit I love LOVE the belt buckles. Having about 42 myself, I was intrigued when I first noticed what I thought read ""SWAG"" after staring for perhaps too long in that general region of one of the staff. (Really super sorry if that creeped you out.) It's actually WCG.

[* When a group of us went to Key West one December to escape of the harsh winter of NWOhio and Detroit, we went to a restaurant the listed ""Dolphin"" as one of its menu items.

When our first waiter arrived, he seemed friendly at first but when I asked him if the flirtini drink was any good, he proceeded to say "" If it wasn't good it wouldn't be on the menu"" We were like, that is not necessarily true but hmm ok. (Needless to say it was good though) 

I ordered the plate of sliders which came with miniatures of the WCG Cheeseburger, BBQ Bacon Burger and Maytag Burger and french fries. I asked that my fries be made without salt because lately I have noticed that fries seem to be caked with salt. Needless to say that when my fries arrived they were COVERED in salt. Ewwww... I looked around and out of nowhere, our new waitress Tiffany (who was also manning the bar) came over and asked if everything was ok. I told her that I had asked for fries with no salt and she said lets just leave these here and I will get some fresh ones out to you. About 5 mins later this huge plate of piping hot no salt added fries arrived and needless to say I devoured all of them. Yes I know greedy but they were so good. Oh and the miniature burgers were yummy as well but ended up bringing home a mini because I was stuffed from all the fries. 

My friend and her mom ordered the rotisserie Chicken Rotisserie Chicken Crêpes which were filled with rotisserie chicken, spinach and a mushroom cream sauce and topped with madeira sauce and parmesan cheese. They both said that it was really good. We also ordered the AZ egg rolls which were traditional egg rolls filled with spicy grilled chicken, corn, black beans and jack cheeses. They had a salsa dip and a jalapeno dip and they were quite yummy. 

Now for dessert, my friend and her mom ordered white chocolate brownie to share. It had french vanilla ice cream, a warm white chocolate brownie, chocolate sauce and whipped cream with white chocolate shavings. I am not a fan of white chocolate but they both seemed to enjoy it.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"My husband and I enjoy coming to WCG when we're in Phoenix however, this may be our last visit. We were in town over the long Memorial Day weekend on our way to the resort we stopped for lunch. I had the Flirtini which was good, we ordered the rib eye sandwich and the dip duo and it was all good. Our waitress was sweet, she had a great personality and took really good care of us. 

We decide to have dinner there on our last night in town, the shrimp cocktail was not cleaned properly and I proceeded to clean the shrimp myself and make a ""poop pile"" on the appetizer plate.  When our waiter (he had NO personality) came by my husband told him to let the chef know that this is unacceptable. He seemed unfazed so I interjected and said ""I love to cook and I would never serve that to a guest"" he mumbled something then walked off with the plate. We ordered the prime rib but they sold out. Okay, no problem bring us the rib/chicken platter with mashed potatoes. The chicken was dry and really had no flavor, the ribs were decent nothing to write home about. 

Our waiter comes back to check on us then leaves a dessert menu on the table when we just started to eat our dinner.  This is my husband's biggest pet peeve, if you ask my husband if he is interested in dessert and he has a plate full of food in front of him your tip just went down. If you ask him if he'd like a coffee or cappuccino when his glass is full of wine, your tip just went down.

Our waiter never came back, we had to ask someone else for our bill. The shrimp cocktail was not taken off of our bill nor was any apology from the manager or chef, no dessert was offered for having to clean the poop shoot of each and every shrimp we ate. 

Long story short, my husband left 0 tip and wrote the waiter a note saying the shrimp cocktail was $13 that would have been your tip but you didn't take the shrimp off of our bill, customers don't want to eat sh*t and shouldn't have to clean their own shrimp because the cook staff is too lazy.",2,"[u' great personality', u' really good', u' own shrimp']",2.1,[u' too lazy'],-0.25

I am obsessed with the crab cakes, that is kind of my go to meal, but the chicken and ribs are out of this world-definitely a Place you will want to come to hungry. They also have hands down the best tortilla soup I have had in the area. 

I also always look forward to their specials.  It's always exciting when you find out they have a house special fish on the menu the evening you arrive, or when they have the spaghetti squash side available, that's the best and there are very few places that will even attempt that.  

For finishing, you always have to get dessert-the white chocolate brownie  is a must, but if you're feeling adventurous, try the apple pie.  You don't expect it but it is hot and fresh out of the oven with a giant scoop of ice cream on almost like a puff pastry croissant crust- you will not be sorry.

I couldn't decide on an entree because all of them sounded good, but again the waiter have great recommendations based on what we had a taste for. I got the Dancing crab cakes and my boyfriend got the perfectly grilled salmon. Both were so very delicious! The only con I have about the entree was that the portions aren't that big which didn't bother us too much because we wanted room for dessert, but if you are just getting an entree you may still be hungry.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"An okay to mediocre experience translates to a 3 star rating on Yelp. That is exactly the rating The White Chocolate Grill deserves. 

Food: We ordered mashed potatoes, but were told they were out of them. However, the waitress told us that they had french fries. I would like to think a restaurant serving french fries can also serve mashed potatoes as they both come from the same original source, the potato. However, they probably use frozen french fries. They were also out of the white chocolate bread pudding.

The alcohol was not great. While they do have a varied range menu options with great aesthetic appeal, the mixing was not proportional. Either too little or too much alcohol. However, it wasn't bad - just not perfect.

Entrees was A-OK. The Jambalaya was underspiced and tasteless. As a Jambalaya fan, this was the worst Jambalaya I have tasted. I tried a little bit of the hamburger meat to get an idea of the quality. It was okay.

Tomato soup was pretty good. Probably the best thing they had.

Dessert: Because they were out of the white chocolate bread pudding, we asked for the white chocolate brownie. Again, it looked fantastic - but the quality was not great. It was too sweet and didn't go down easy. Almost like an Applebee's dessert. It's easy to see when a dessert option was prepared with time and craft. These weren't.

Service: Good service. They didn't charge us for the white chocolate brownie because the waitress felt bad that they didn't have a lot of the things we ordered.

This place is a total Houston's rip-off.  Seriously, the decor is the same, the smell when you walk in is the same, the servers' outfits, the menu, the drinks, the silverware - I guess you see the point.
So I ask the server, ""are you affiliated with Houston's?"" 
He goes off on a story about how the WCG is an original concept and much better than Houston's - yada yada, save it for someone who isn't an aficionado of the Houston's persuasion.
If you are going to say all of that, and clearly be a rip-off of my *favorite* restaurant, then you had better live up to the name.  And frankly, they don't.  I had the seared ahi tuna salad with mango and avocado (surprisingly, Houston's has the EXACT SAME SALAD - only better).   It was good, as I was jonesing for some tuna - but I could have done without the heavy sesame crust and the drenching with dressing.  My dad has the rotisserie chicken, and was so disappointed that they ended up taking it off of the bill (it was cold and dry).  We both had fresh-squeezed Arnold Palmer's - and they had ooky sugar-coated rims.  No thanks.
The french fries were excellent, yay french fries.  Oh, and surprisingly, you can get them with mustard-honey dressing, just like at Houston's - though again, it wasn't as good.
You know, it is probably a 3-star restaurant, but I was so put-off by the whole ""we aren't Houston's and that restaurant sucks"" attitude - when they are so clearly trying to be Houston's, that I will not ever be back.  If I want Houston's I will get the real thing, and it will taste better.
Plus, I think the name is super lame.  The service was fine, the place is fine - but just go get the real thing, it is worth the wait.

**UPDATE**
I upped my star rating to 3 because the GM contacted me and explained a bunch about the restaurant.  I really appreciate such personalized customer service - he certainly didn't have to be so nice.  So, I will try WCG again and hopefully pull the rating up another star!  I still think the name is funny . . .

** ANOTHER UPDATE **
I was harassed by a fellow ""reviewer"" of the WCG who was clearly affiliated with the restaurant.  This ""reviewer"" has no other reviews and is a bit fishy.  I do not appreciate being contacted to argue about the experience I had and this type of activity destroys the integrity of Yelp.

For an appetizer, we had the grilled artichoke with aioli sauce (which was recommended by the waitress, supposedly it's one of their popular appetizers). we've never tried a full artichoke before, but it was actually good..you could smell and taste the wood grill in the artichoke and it was even better with the aioli sauce. Just wish there was more to eat because towards the middle it was mainly just the leaves so there was not much to eat. 

For dinner we had the Rotisserie chicken crepes with mashed potatoes topped with mushrooms!! lots of mushrooms!! and their signature gravy. This was truly amazing! Their gravy had such great flavoring that it made everything just taste so good!  (we couldn't finish it so we took it to go, heated it up the next day and it was still THAT good!) 

We also had their Balsamic Ribeye with Israeli couscous. They could of used a bit more balsamic for their ribeye just to add a bit more flavor to it, but overall it was good, not bad. 

and last but not least the white chocolate banana cream pie for dessert!!!!!!!!! I was mainly excited for this particular dessert and it was soooo yummy!!!!

This restaurant has a very sleek modern look and the inside is very dark as if trying to create more intimacy at the tables. The menu offers mostly sandwiches, burgers,  various meats, and some salads. I was not in the mood for meat, but was to hungry for a salad so this put me in a bit of a dilemma. Finally I decided to order the club sandwich with a side choice of steamed broccoli. The broccoli was actually my favorite thing I ordered. It was steamed perfectly and sprinkled with what I believe was Parmesan cheese and some sort of red pepper. It was really delicious! My sandwich was really good as well, but I thought it was a little pricey. Later we followed our meal with a molten chocolate souffl. The souffl was amazing and came out with a layer of white chocolate around it. There were many other white chocolate dessert items going along with the restaurants name such as a white chocolate brownie. I also had a taste of their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake, but it was a bit to tart for my liking.

Had dinner here last night for my birthday because apparently several of my husband's coworkers highly recommended this place. I'm not sure what food they're used to that they consider this good, but I certainly did not. The highlight of our meal was the appetizer and the vegetable of the day. Other than that, it was barely edible. 

Starting with drinks, I had a pear martini and hubby had a Long Island iced tea. The martini was thick and excessively sweet. Tasted like cheap pancake syrup. The Long Island was standard, nothing great but not bad. Though I would suggest a different glass or maybe a different colored straw, because halfway through our meal someone walked by (not our waiter) and topped it off with regular iced tea before we could even say anything.

For an appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail. I'd say this is pretty hard to mess up, but what made it really great were the sauces. It came with cocktail sauce as well as a jalapeño sauce. They were both fantastic! I assumed they were made in house, but I guess it's quite possible that the 1 thing we liked wasn't even made in the restaurant. 

For dinner I ordered scallops (not on the menu, they were a special) with the vegetable of the day, and hubby had the BBQ trio with fries. 

My scallops were awful. They came atop a lemon beurre blanc.  Both the sauce and the scallops were cold, they were missing the beautiful sear that I expect to see on scallops, and they were undercooked (still slimy in the middle). The vegetable of the day was a corn salad. That was the only good thing on the plate. It had corn, tomatoes, zucchini and queso fresco and it was delicious. I plan to make it at home.

Hubby's BBQ trio was nothing special. It had pulled pork, ribs, and rotisserie chicken. The meats were cooked well, the problem was the BBQ sauce was sugary sweet. Not really to our liking. The side of fries was the worst part of the dish. The menu touts fresh cut fries, well let me tell you, what we got was a soggy, greasy pile of junk. They didn't even look appetizing. I wish I had gotten a picture of them just to see how many people might actually be willing to eat them. I'm sure not many. 

As far as decor goes, if you've ever been in a Firebirds, you've seen the inside of this place. Everything from the dark wood, to the open kitchen, to the back-lit liquor bottles at the bar. It's all the same. And the food at Firebirds is much better. 

The one positive I can speak to (and the only reason for giving 2 stars instead of 1) was the service. We had a reservation and we were seated very quickly even though we arrived 20 mins early. And our waiter was very attentive and friendly.

Cold mashed potatoes in water... I mean gravy - we thought maybe they were trying something avant-garde but nope, they were in fact cold mashed potatoes which were quickly - I assume - microwaved since they were returned to our table in about 2 minutes.

Soggy blackened fish burger with bun and condiment quality akin to In-N-Out Burger (I'm not exaggerating - check out the pics).

Watery cream-based gin tomato soup (house specialty).  Wish I had something to rave about here.

It was our first time dining at the restaurant and I''m not quite sure if we'll be going back...  It was a night of sub par service, average food but a really great dessert.  We were turned on by a friend who raved about their Baby Back Ribs with the glazed carrots. So being from the south I can appreciate a nice slab of meat but this was either an off night or my friend has horrible taste.

We were greeted and sat almost immediately to our arrival without a reservation. We were put at a booth for 2 in the bar which wasn't as bad as one might think. The restaurant isn't a loud and rowdy one so a bar atmosphere was very mellow.  But after being sat we didn't get any form of acknowledgment for almost 10 minutes. No water, no hello, nothing. 

Finally the server came over and instead of apologizing for the delay, asked if we had any questions with the menu. My date replied with, "" we've actually had enough time to memorize it by now so we're good, thanks!""  Awkward. :)  To save time we went ahead and ordered our drinks and our dinners in the first go around with the waitress.

We're not in a rush so let us enjoy our meal! The meal itself looked great on the plate. Carrots were steaming and the garlic mashed potatoes were plentiful, however cold for both of our entrees.  Unfortunately the waitress never came back to check on us so I had to walk over to the bar and ask the bartender to find her for us.  When she finally came over she tried to take our plates so as she could reheat the meal instead of just bringing us fresh potatoes.  Common sense is lost sometimes on people...

Ok now to a good point!  The white chocolate raspberry cheesecake! Amazing.  Creamy, rich and sweet!  Priced right and calorie free!  Well up until the first bite im sure...

The four of us went to dinner at WCG on a saturday night at around 9 pm. We had a 10 minute wait, and afterwards we sat at a comfortable booth. The atmosphere is very nice and is good for a relaxing meal. To start, I shared the AZ egg rolls with my girlfriend. These come with 6 pieces (3 egg rolls cut in half), and coupled with a jalapeno ranch type dip and a side of salsa, all over shredded lettuce. 

For dinner I ordered the Prime Rib french dip sandwich. The sandwich is delicious. It comes topped with horseradish sauce, a side of au jus, and a side order. I recommend the mashed potatoes, I ordered the fresh cut french fries, though these need work. They do not taste like fresh cut fries, but like greasy lower tier french fries.

For desert we shared the bread pudding and the white chocolate brownie. The brownie was meh, maybe a 5/10, but the bread pudding was great. Mix it with vanilla ice cream (which it doesn't come with, we took the ice cream off the brownie), and it's perfect.

I give White Chocolate Grill a solid 4 stars.

Egg rolls were around $9.00, Prime Rib french dip was $14.99, and the bread pudding was like $9.00. Not bad for a 3 course Saturday night.",4,"[u' comfortable booth', u' very nice', u' fresh cut', u' fresh cut', u' Not bad']",2.13,[],0

Our party had the AZ eggrolls, the chicken crepes, filet mignon cobb salad, the NY strip and the white ras. cheesecake. The salad was very large, easy to share with 2... the steaks were done as ordered, the chicken crepes I was told were so-so and the cheesecake was very rich and easy to share with 4. 
The service was also very good; quick and kind server... came back to the table several times to check on us.
Cons - The only con for us was the noise level. We sat near the semi-enclosed open kitchen area so we really had to talk loudly to hear each other from across the table. Noise seems to carry here just because of the large layout and high ceilings.
I would certainly go back again... perhaps just request to be seated away from the kitchen area, especially if you are with any soft spoken people.",4,"[u' good variety', u' very large', u' very rich', u' very good']",2.376071429,[],0

I've had some great things and some meh things here. For appetizers, the shrimp cocktail and guacamole are winners!  The guacamole is actually remarkably good...my only comment there is that the chips are soooo thin and the guacamole soooo chunky that you actually can't use your chip as a scoop because they just break.   But the artichoke appetizer is just not exciting and too wet. 

For entrees, I've had great burgers, a super French Dip,  and some great salads.  But a few losers are  chicken Madeira with overpowering sauce, the scallops which I thought were overcooked, and today's filet mignon Cobb salad. The steak on the salad was blue and they hadn't asked how I wanted it when I ordered. I think if you're not going to ask, medium would've been a safer bet than blue-rare.  They did take it off my bill though.

We all had something different. 
I had chicken crepes, very rich, lots of mushrooms, very tasty. Good job. 
My boyfriend ordered a Prime Rib, which they were out of, and he ended up ordering another steak, which was tasty.
My friend had a cobb salad. More items in the salad than lettuce, yummy, good job. 
Her boyfriend had a prime rib dip. Which is made out of prime rib, which we were told they were out of. I guess it is pre made? Not sure. But the sandwich was really bland, definitely not the best dish on the menu. 

Now, the mashed potatoes. I was NOT a fan. Who puts nutmeg or cloves in mashed potatoes and doesn't tell a person!?!? I see mashed potatoes and thing, YUM, butter, maybe milk, maybe cream, maybe even garlic. But nutmeg and cloves? Unless you like that, don't order the mashed potatoes. 

Now, the not so tasty mashed potatoes also came with a hair. Doesn't totally gross me out, but isn't pleasant. I asked for mashed potatoes to go, hoping I would like them later, but nope I did not. However, the manager comped some desserts and whatnot to make up for it. We did not ask for this, so I am assuming he did because we were really nice and easy going about the whole matter. 

So, although parts of the dishes I would not order again, because of the other food, the service, and the overall care of the manager (generosity as well), I would definitely go back.

The food itself was alright but nothing mind-blowingly spectacular. For appetizers, we had the chips and spinach artichoke dip which was extremely cheesy and creamy but not overpoweringly so. An excellent appetizer, I must say.

Next was the entree. I ordered the blackened mahi. It was topped with crab meat and tomato creole. Didn't really taste much of the creole sauce but the crab meat was pretty good. The mahi itself was kinda bland and didn't have much flavor. A friend ordered the citrus-glazed soy salmon or something and I had a bite of that and it was pretty good! But on the side, the honey-roasted carrots were super awesome. They were soft, gooey but not mashed gooey, sweet, and just very flavorfull.

And finally dessert, the white chocolate brownie was quite good. Complex in its design and presentation but simple in its taste. But sometimes, simplicity tastes excellent! What we have is essentially a brownie topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and ribbon-like shavings of white chocolate. Can't go wrong with that, yeah?

So in the end, I'd give this place a 3.5 stars. The food, while good, wasn't spectacular and my mahi was kinda bland.

Turned out I was right on both counts. We ended up getting the ""date night"" menu... 4 courses for $30 each. Insane amounts of food. 

We had:
First course - grilled artichokes. best artichokes I've ever had. they're grilled perfectly and sprinkled with Parmesan so full of flavor.
Salad course - blue cheese bacon salad. ridiculous. i probably had more calories in this salad than in a normal entire dinner. But hey, when you're going big...
Entree - we both got fillet mignon. mine had balsamic mushrooms and you chose a side to go along. the mushrooms were a bit aggressive on the vinegar, otherwise perfectly cooked.
Dessert - white chocolate bread pudding with creme anglaise. bring on another obscene dose of fat (it's made with croissants) and tons of sugar. oh so good though.

Quality of food overall was good, but it was really more about having your dessert and eating it too just in terms of everything being full on fat+flavor. If I lived in the area, I'd love to come here for happy hour drinks and apps, and save a full meal for a rare treat, after lots of working out.",4,"[u' so good', u' happy hour', u' full meal', u' rare treat']",2.15,[u' very bad'],-0.91

The highly attentive and well trained staff look like they were hand picked from a J.Crew catalog.  Bar area is stadium seating with cool high ceilings, and comfortable plush  leather seats.  Even the bathrooms were minimalist class in stone grey w/recessed candle cubbies. 

Food is as amazing as the ambiance - Cajun Chicken sandwich was one of the best I've had. Reportedly good burgers with melted in to patty cheese and salads. It was so good on my last day and given there are many other eateries to try in the area I was drawn back to the same place to see if they could repeat the performance.  

They did and it was actually even better - amazing team service - awesome steak and turkey sandwich and some unidentifiably delicious mashed potatoes and mystery gravy.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Well it was very busy on a Wednesday, but we had reservations so we did not wait long. It was a little too dark for me and a little too loud. Which was a problem with the very soft spoken waiter, but no matter how many times you asked him to repeat himself, he didn't get the point of raising his voice at all.

Then there is the food, pretty good, BUT when I am paying $25-$30 for a plate, I would actually like to have some food on it!  These portions were so small it was laughable. It was my husband's birthday and I felt terrible when I saw his plate because he is a big eater. Also, you only get one side, first place I've been too that doesn't come with two sides and no freaking salads either. Anyway when we got home, after spending almost $200, my husband had to make himself another plate of food to be satisfied.  Unfortunately the side portions were very skimpy, not even probably a half cup portion!

I had the crab cakes, which weren't bad, but I would really not call them an actual ""cake"", you actually think of something puck sized and these were two pitiful dollops of crab. My son made out the best, he had the cheapest plate and got the most food! Burger and fries!

I am for certain never wasting my money here again. When I spend that much money on dinner, I want to leave satisfied and we definitely were not'",2,"[u' many times', u' pretty good', u"" n't bad""]",1.325,"[u' too dark', u' so small']",-0.4
UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"Let me just start by saying OMG!!! My hubby and I were in the neighborhood and came here for lunch. walking up to the place you see a huge outdoor covered patio with big cushy chairs and huge fireplace. Great place to chill while waiting in the cooler AZ months (they also have a huge dining patio on the back of the building with an even bigger fireplace). Upon walking in the front door, there are lit rock walls with dark wood through out. To your right is the bar with a floor to ceiling liquor wall that is lit from behind making the whole wall glow with booze!! It's very eye catching. The seats in the bar area are quite unique too, all half booths which face the wall o' booze and a few large flat screen tv's, it's also teared like stadium seating.
We sat in the main dining room just to the left of the bar. It was a very upscale, yet chill/cozy atmosphere.  throughout the main dining area are mostly all cozy booths and half booths. the lighting is dim but not so dim that you can't see your hand in front of your face or so dim you can't read the menu.
The wait staff is very friendly, accommodating, and efficient. The prices, are actually quite decent. I didn't see anything on the lunch or dinner menu that was a break the bank kind of price. Since we were there for lunch, we just had a sandwich and salad. My hubby got the French Dip. I know that sounds average and boring, but it was the best looking and best tasting french dip i think I've ever had and my hubby said the same thing! It was freshly sliced roast beef, like prime rib sliced thin on a french baguette. The meat was buttery soft and melted in your mouth. I just had a salad, their Southern chicken salad. it was HUGE! It's a salad, not much to say with that other than it was also very good. The most awesome part of our dinning experience was dessert!! this is a place you go to where you NEED to save room for their desserts! We split the White Chocolate Brownie. This thing was a meal in itself! the brownie had to be at least 3 or 4 inches square then topped with vanilla ice cream and white chocolate shavings. When the brought it out it had to have stood about a foot tall! We devoured it! how we had room for that is anybodies guess. It's very rich and decadent and you can bes' believe I was at the gym for a loooong time to work that off my waist! So well worth every single calorie!! I'd say this is a great date night spot! Can't wait to get back up there to enjoy their dinner menu and another over-the-top dessert!!!",5,"[u' huge outdoor', u' big cushy', u' huge fireplace', u' Great place', u' huge dining', u' quite unique', u' very friendly', u' very good', u' awesome part', u' very rich', u' great date']",6.51,"[u' dark wood', u' cozy booths', u' over-the-top dessert']",-0.85

It was girls dinner out - five of us gals on a Saturday night - we had reservations and were seated close to our time.  It was a stormy night and they had to close the outside patio, so they were really slammed with diners.

One gal ordered the grilled artichoke appetizer and it was so delish!  I will definetly order this next time.   For my main dish I had the Dancing Crab Cakes and Holy Crab!  There was no filler - all yummy crab - served with a plain tarter sauce which they didn't need, so wasn't too sad it didn't have a creative dipping sauce.     I was so into my dish - I don't even remember what everyone else had.   

The best part was the dessert - only two of us were having dessert and on the top of the dessert menu - it says ""desserts for two"" - well....we still ordered two of them to share!   

White chocolate banana cream pie was my choice and it really had an amazing flavor, but the dessert you must have is the French white chocolate bread pudding - wow - wow - wow!   I am not a big fan of bread puddings, but this is made with croissants and is not your typical bread pudding.  it melts in your mouth with white chocolate godiva liquer, caramel sauce, and golden raisens.   You must save room for dessert!

My only complaint is that the restaurant is so loud - it was really hard to carry a conversation with your table - it also is a bit dark which is great for a romantic couple dinner, but not the best for a gals night out.

The service was excellent, the food came out quickly and everything was very tasty.  Here are the highlights I would go back for in an instant:

* Grilled Artichokes - they were excellent and so was the aioli they serve it with
* WGC Bacon Blue Cheese Salad - excellent and even the ""side"" salad portion was sizable
* Honey Roasted Carrots - I never thought I would actually like to eat carrots but these were phenomenal and an excellent side
* Corn Salad - this was also an excellent side.  Fresh cut corn off the cob with some other stuff in a light dressing.  Very very good.

I ordered some steak thing that was a special.  It wasn't memorable so next time I'm going to stick to what is on the regular menu.  My wife ordered the trout and it was excellent.

We went during the lunch hour on Friday, and were seated in the bar area...the only downside was the 5 table group adjacent to us celebrating some business milestone - not a big deal.    However, mgmt must have been unprepared as our server took much too long at 1135am to get the job done.  They were obviously understaffed for the day...it was busy - a good thing.  

Wife had a shrimp salad, daughter - the enchiladas or burritos - and I chose the (yikes) Mahi Mahi with Crab.  Wife and daughter immediately remarked, when we were served, ""something smells weird"".  I have the constitution of a marine...so was 100% unaffected..until about 5 minutes after we left and went to BBB across the parking lot.  I've never been so ill from food in my life.  I spent the entire afternoon in the restroom and am still paranoid about solid foods.

The worst part is I mentioned this to someone at my golf club and learned their husband went thru the same thing a couple of weeks ago - same dish, same location.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"This place has a great atmosphere, perfect for dates, groups, and girl's night! I came with my parents for a family dinner. We came on a Friday night without a reservation in mid-July, and had only a 15-20 minute wait. We got drinks at the bar and hung out. At some of the tables in the bar area, you can seat yourself if they're open. A waiter came and let us know, which was really nice of him. We ended up being beat to the table, but we weren't worried!

I enjoyed a pomegranate martini. It was delicious, and I love that they bring you a chilled glass about halfway through. Totally unnecessary, but TOTALLY appreciated! We shared the spinach/artichoke dip as an app. Yummy! I had the bleu cheese crusted filet, which was perfectly prepared. Dad had the ribs/chicken combo and thought the ribs were surprisingly good for a non-barbeque place. Mom had some kind of salad, and it was huge. When she was done, she barely looked like she touched it. We tried the White chocolate banana cream pie.... it was a little weird. Came on a crust that looked like a cookie. Dad said it was okay, but then.... I noticed a very small hair on the whipped cream. We quietly told the waitress, who immediately apologized and offered another. Since we weren't impressed, we declined. She comped the desert and our appetizer.

Food was great, drinks were great, desert was just fine. Service is where WCG shined. We were really impressed with the way the waitress and the manager treated this hair.

With the dim lights setting into the area, it almost seemed like a little smoky and magical within the restaurant.  That might also have to do a lot with the kitchen closer to the dining area.  It was neat to actually see the chefs in action, as though I was watching an episode of Hell's Kitchen.

The food was absolutely stunning.  We got a light caprese appetizer.  The flavors of the balsamic, oregano, and olive oil was amazing.  As my main entree,  I got the Famous Chicken Salad.  The chicken was kind of braised and it tasted tender with the balsamic vinagrette dressing.  The light appetizer and salad was a good segway to a white chocolate brownie.  I got a white chocolate martini to pair my dessert.  The brownie came with tasty vanilla bean ice cream and shaved white chocolate pieces.  I am not a big martini person, but this had a flavor of liqueur to go along with the white chocolate taste.

One of the first things you'll notice inside is the bar with liquor bottles stacked to the top of the ceiling.  Cool and colorful little aesthetic touch.  The seating and atmosphere otherwise though is tough to distinguish from the other various finer dining establishments in the Scottsdale area.

We started off with the spinach and artichoke dip.  Gotta say I was less than impressed with it.  Generally I prefer this type of dip to be thicker and heartier, but the dip was pretty runny watered down for my taste.  It was passable, but unimpressive.  For the entrée I went on the lighter side got the citrus soy salmon and couscous.  Pretty good overall as the salmon was cooked adequately and the couscous was light and subtle.  For dessert my girlfriend and I tried two things.  We got the bread pudding and the white chocolate brownie.  Now these did not disappoint.  The white chocolate brownie was decadent, flaky, flavorful, and dense.  The bread pudding was huge and had croissants as the bread which gave it a great texture.

Overall I give this place a so-so rating for a couple of reasons.  As mentioned earlier, the atmosphere is relatively blah.  It's nice, but other than the bar setup, there's nothing unique or interesting about it.  The appetizer and entrée were good, but not worth the fairly pricey tab that came with them in my opinion.  The desserts though are very impressive and are worth saving room for.  And our server was very friendly and attentive.  If the rest of the experience matched the desserts, I'd give it a 5 star rating.

This is one of my standard places to bring folks when we're looking for a nice and cool place to grab a bite.

It's great for lunch (good burgers and sandwiches at good prices - and the fries?  wow!)

Dinner is my favorite though - almost always goes something like this:

Appetizer - Seared Ahi - comes on a bed of slaw that's got curry(?) in it - heck, I'll not fight too hard for the Ahi if you let me have your share of the slaw!  It's that good (hey WCG - maybe make that a side dish?  :-))

If the crowd is big (or hungry), add the southwest egg rolls -they're also very good.

Main course - Balsamic Ribeye - marinated in a balsamic reduction (overnight, IIRC), then grilled to order - served with fresh tomato slices with some balsamic reduction drizzled on them - for the side, get the honey glazed carrots - best carrots ever!!!

I pretty much live off of grilled meat.  More specifically, grilled chicken, steak, and salmon. So when I saw the menu item at WCG called ""perfectly grilled salmon"" I was like 'yeah right it's going to be just as boring as salmon is everywhere else.'    
But was I ever wrong.  It is just exactly that: perfectly grilled.  It's crispy on the outside and just right in the center. It is so good that I am inclined to go back and find out how they do it.  

My Fiance had the baby back ribs, which she said were about a ""7,"" which for her is pretty good.  We also had the white chocolate brownie which was very rich and delicious, but probably not good enough to warrant the calories.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"I took a friend of mine out for her birthday last Friday (May 9th) and The White Chocolate Grill was her choice.  Neither of us had been there before but the menu looked very intriguing.  The facility is stylish and intimate - better suited for couples than just friends - and we were seated quickly and courteously.  

I ordered the Citrus-Soy Glazed Salmon.  It was over cooked and floating in far too much, and quite non-distinctive, juice.  I didn't finish it.  When the wait person asked if I wanted it boxed I honestly told her that ""it wouldn't be worth it.""

My friend had the Blackened Mahi.  The menu indicates that it was 'grilled, topped with crab meat and a tomato Creole sauce"".  When it arrived we both wondered where the crab meat was.  We envisioned something that would be at least visible.  She said that it was 'ok'.  I was probably more disappointed that she was because this was part of her birthday 'gift'.  

For desert we split the White Chocolate Raspberry Cheesecake.  Although it was good I personally couldn't help thinking that is was just a 'dressed-up' Costco cheesecake.  

The wait person was pleasant but disinterested and didn't even put a candle in the desert even though she knew it was my friend's BD.  I raise this as an issue only because sometimes the wait person can make turn an unpleasant experience around by doing something 'special'.  But it apparently never occurred to her that she was an integral part of the 'dining experience.'  

Overall, our experience at TWCG was mediocre and in this price tier Houston's has them beat 10 to 1!

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"This was the fourth time that I've been to the White Chocolate Grill.  It was also the last.

The food here, while not gifted with any superstars or outstanding and memorable dishes, is what I can best classify as ""good, if a bit expensive.""  Except for the chocolate souffle cake, which tasted Easy Bake Oven-esque, the eats here are good, at the very least.  The ambiance is fine, too.

What's not good, decent, adequate or at all enjoyable, and the reason that I won't be coming back, is the service.  It's one thing if the guy who's supposed to get drinks says he'll be getting us water and will be coming back to take the actual drink orders in a minute ends up taking seven (despite us being about 15 feet from the bar, where one assumes water can be filled into beverage containers), and then forgets to take the actual drink order.  It's a whole other thing when the server is just terrible.

""I'll bring you some plates for your appetizer,"" he said after setting it down.  Ten minutes later, our table plateless, he asked how it was while refilling my water glass.  He was so shocked that he forgot to bring the plates that he over-poured my water, spilling it onto the table.  He didn't clean it up.

He forgot to bring the requested condiments with our entrées until ten minutes after they'd been on the table (no idea why it was always in tens).  He conscripted other waiters into delivering our food, asking how the food was, and cleaning off the table (which he, at no point, really did - appetizer plates were still on the table by the time dessert was ordered).  He was scowling at us when talking to the table, but was much nicer to the table next to ours.

When you get down to it, choosing a restaurant is half about the food and half about the experience.  And in this case, the experience was bad enough to make sure that I won't come back. 

Both stars are for the food, which as I mentioned before, was pretty good.  Just not good enough to justify the terrible server.",2,"[u' memorable dishes', u' pretty good']",0.975,"[u' not good', u' just terrible', u' so shocked', u' not good', u' terrible server']",-3.4
UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"This place is a Cheesecake Factory Restaurant wannabe.

I decided to write this review with apprehension. Much to mention and much to question.

Not trying to make enemies in Phoenix with the yelpers, or for that matter the restaurants but I will start by questioning the yelp reviewers from this area and why  3 star restaurants (clearly just an A OK where I am from) are being rated 4 and 5 stars? This place is simply not a 4 or 5 star where I come from. Yes I am being snobby but thats partly what yelp is about.

Let's just say that I have spent much time on the phone with management and the insurance company trying to resolve my issues here @ this restaurant. I have been promised that my issues are being addressed and that management takes them very serious. I do have reason to doubt but will give them the benefit of the doubt for now.

The great service that people claim here is ok (3 stars) but the people operate like they are on auto pilot. They know the company motto, fast and service with a smile but it fails to be anything personable and i just find personality equates into stars...more stars than just one. The food runner asked who was eating one dish, placed it in front of the wrong person and while we were saying ""no"" he kept putting down the second wrong meal ( when you get one meal placement wrong, chances are you'll get two or more wrong). We started to switch the plates ourselves since the food runner was already running back to the kitchen.

Food, the food was ok, seriously ok, just ok. See, three ok's equal three stars not 4 or 5 stars. The steak 6.5 ounce was cooked right but was just ok. Again, ok is 3 stars on yelp. The rotisserie chicken, 3 stars, just ok. The caprese salad, odd with cherry tomatoes with lil balls of mozzarella, balsamic vinegar...ummm guess how many stars? Yup, 3, quite possibly a 2. The dessert was the banana thingamajig, I didn't partake so let's say a zero for that which won't effect the overall score. It is cute that desserts are placed at the top of the menu in the beginning but they should put the dessert at the top of the bill too. One weird thing, when seated with two kids and two adults, they switched the kids black napkin roll ups with white ones? Hmmm, profiling kids? Why?

The place is dark, loud but good people watching place. Nice fire pit outside for waiting, lines move rather quickly but seriously it's a knock off of the cheesecake factory but the cheesecake factory is much better!

I reserve the right to re-star depending on the outcome of the management and the insurance companies response.",3,"[u' great service', u' seriously ok', u' many stars', u' good people']",2.5,"[u' very serious', u' wrong person', u' wrong meal', u' weird thing']",-1.933333333

We made a reservation on the patio since the inside tables for a party of five were already booked. They said the patio was heated and has a fireplace. Great! 

On arrival, we were seated underneath a spinning ceiling fan next to an idle heater. The waitress tried in vain to fire up the heater and could not turn off the fan. They turned on the overhead heaters for awhile then they mysteriously turned off. Why?

The patio was also a little dark; several wall sconces had burned out bulbs. This immediately put us in a bad mood. Although the food was really good, we suffered through dinner with our jackets on. We could not move to the empty table next to the fireplace because it was ""reserved."" Consequently, the fireplace table was never occupied! 

White Chocolate Grill - get your act together. Check your lights, heaters, and fans BEFORE you seat people on the patio. The table next to us complained as well so it wasn't just my problem.

Not a great spectrum to what is an already established restaurant and menu a la houstons.  

My number one suggestion is do not order the burger...of any type.. which i unfortunately did last night.  Its pretty awfully dry (although ordered medium rare), with what amounts to a cup of grated raw cheese thrown over it on a tiny little bun.

When eaten with the caramel sauce, it was a delicious, perfectly sweet dessert, but if you had to take a bite without the caramel sauce (which was often necessary due to the small amount of caramel provided), it wasn't sweet enough and also lacked an in depth flavor profile.

Something else to note about the WCG is that it's an excellent restaurant in the area for take-out!  I've ordered take-out from the WCG on numerous occasions, and the food is always hot, fresh, and delicious, and usually comes with plenty of rolls and deliciously addictive butter.

I would recommend the WCG for locals, and travelers, as it's right off the 101 for a convenient stop while traveling.",4,"[u' golden raisins', u' warm curry', u' excellent texture', u' perfectly sweet', u' excellent restaurant', u' always hot']",3.5,"[u' small amount', u"" n't sweet""]",-0.425

They sat us at a booth that had a horrible stench of dirty mildew. We moved tables, but they were all the same. For just opening for the day this was just disgusting. We had their chips and guacamole to start and the chips were old and stale and for my entree I had their ""famous chicken salad"" and I can tell you it was far from famous.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"I really wish I could rate their food and their desserts differently using the yelp 'stars', but sadly I can't.  More on that in a bit.

One of the first things you notice about this place when you step in the door is how strikingly it resembles 'Houstons' -- the set of chain restaurants.   As other reviewers have pointed out, they really seem to want to emulate this chain.  

Badly.  

The interior is cool and dark, they have the same style Houstons high-back booths, and even the menu is pretty much the same.  Right down to the thin-cut fries!  

I ordered their club sandwich and fries (because I have little faith in 'trendy' restaurants that serve American fare -- and I figured it would be hard to screw up a club sandwich).  I was pleasantly surprised by their version of a club -- with hand cut turkey and apple-smoked bacon.  It was 'good' -- not 'excellent-and-I-need-to-come-back-here-to-enjoy-this-again'.

Where the White Chocolate Grill really shines is in its dessert selection.  Their desserts are quite good.  A bit more expensive than most places, but they give you large portions.  I ordered the 'White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie' and was surprised to get not a slice -- but a whole small pie!  The pie WAS 'excellent-and-I-need-to-come-back-here-to-enjoy-this-again'.  Its served cold over a very thick (and tasty) graham cracker crust, with shavings of white chocolate as garnish on top.

And man, if you like white chocolate you'll be in heaven in this place.  5 out of the 6 desserts offered by the White Chocolate grill have white chocolate in them.

I would give their desserts 4 stars, and their food 3 stars.

We finally get to experience this restaurant last night and my first exciting appetizer order is to try this amazing soup my husband keeps raving about ""Gin tomato soup"" now for some reason I thought it was gin as in ginger tomato soup it didn't even dawn on me that he was talking about gin as in the alcohol until after,  I'm sooo excited to taste this soup and I took my first bite and it was amazingly good with a big kick... I was like what's in here now cuz I don't taste the ginger my husband says ""no it's not goner it's gin"" lol... Duh' he had to help me finish it! But, it was very delicious!

Everyone in here were sooo pleasantly nice and funny! I love when the waiters are relax and just have some humor in them it really breaks up the monotonous environment of being in a restaurant and being funny/laughing is good for the soul! We had Patrick as our waiter and another gentleman he was hilarious to have around just loved his personality! Both Patrick and him are amazing people and they know what's best for a first time customer such as myself... 

We had their balsamic steaks and my husband/I shared I can't eat a whole steak by myself and I hate left overs never tastes the same. But, the balsamic steak that Patrick suggested to us was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G we had it at medium and it has so many Flavors going through your taste buds as it is aged steak marinated! To me that's a yummy steak where you are able to taste so much Flavors! 

The next favorite that Patrick suggested we get was the bread pudding and I'm so blessed we had him as our waiter the bread pudding was off the chain! Sooo yummy I want to go back and have another steak/bread pudding/wedge salad!

My girlfriend and I were looking to have sushi at that place down the parking lot, but they weren't open yet. So we said ""hey let's try this place"" and walked into WCG.

First thoughts.. ""ok this looks kinda nice and fancy""   The hostess was really nice and sat us quickly.  The waiter came over and got us drinks pretty fast and was also really nice and helpful. 

Looking over the menu I wanted something light but also something that i was familiar with, so I went with a simple club sandwich.  

Let me tell you history with club sandwiches for a moment. Every time I have one at other places, they are always the same.  One sandwich, cut into different triangles, stacked 5"" tall with a tooth pic in each slice.  That's fine.  Many places are also dry.

How does WCG do it?  They use one whole sandwich, stack it high with FRESH ingredients, slice it ONCE in half and it also comes with a nice side sauce (forgot the kind).  I also got a side of fries with it. I don't think in the history of having club sandwiches, have I ever verbally made a noise when eating a sandwich.  My girlfriend even commented to me ""Enjoying your food?""  

It was THE best club I've had.  

She got a spicy chicken sandwich that she really enjoyed too!

This place has a casual feel but it's also classy at the same time because they dim their lights. It's definitely not a sports bar, it's classy than that. 

+Happy hour starts @ 2pm and ends at 7pm - Great time! 
+Cheap food and drinks 

Our waiter was very nice and came back to check on us in terms of drinks and food. 

We shared fries, the sliders and the egg rolls (the waiter recommended the egg rolls). The fries remind me of shoe string fries and those are delicious! Good fries with lots of different types of dipping sauce. I personally like the 'ranch,' it had more flavor to it than typical ranch dressing. My friend like the BBQ sauce that came with it. The fries are good.

The sliders and egg rolls are nothing spectacular. They're good but not amazing. I feel like the sliders and egg rolls remind me of items they also sell at TGIF or some other chain restaurant. - Overall, it's not bad.

It is very luxurious ordering from a menu that starts with the desserts.  We split the guacamole which was pretty good.  Good flavor, not bland.  The chips were too salty for my tasting, but a friend loved how much salt there was.  The salsa was good too, nice and spicy.  I ordered the crab cakes for dinner which were awesome.  Two crab cakes with large lumps of yummy crab.  Not breaded (the best kind of crab cakes), and as the accompaniment I chose the couscous.  The couscous was pretty good on first taste, then all the mayo and nuts in it made it feel so heavy in my stomach.  I think I ate about 5 small bites and couldn't eat anymore.  

We shared the bread pudding for dessert.  It was hard to gauge how good it was as I was sooooo full already.  It was pretty good for bread pudding, the white chocolate sauce was tasty.  I'm a fan of regular 'ol chocolate (esp. dark...mmm) but the white chocolate-ness of this dessert was pretty delicious.

Thank God that I reserved a table in advance with an easy on-line service on their website, because apparently this place is very popular and was pretty crowded already at 6 pm on a Sunday night. In my reservation I specified that we were celebrating our anniversary and all of my requests about a quiet romantic table were satisfied :o) It was actually very nice to receive greetings from the staff too!

When you don't have to use the salt and pepper shakers at a meal, you know it's good! We started off with the AZ spring rolls, they were perfectly crunchy on the outside and served with yummy side sauce choices ( I told the waiter I could of ate 20 more)!  For the entree I had the Crab Cakes and Garlic Filet Mignon, served with  mashed potatoes and their  ""good gravy"". The tarter sauce on the Crab Cakes was home made and was perfect, I could of licked that sauce bowl. The ""good gravy"" was really f'ing good! It wasn't a traditional brown gravy but more of a clear color. I am a mashed potatoe whore so I know good potatoes and these were killer! I didn't need to use any kind of sauce for my crab cakes or filet, they were good just the way they came, filled with flavor. I also ordered a Long Island that was one of the best I've ever had, later the waiter told me the sweet and sour was home made too!
Being so impressed with everything, we decided to do two desserts. We had the white chocolate brownie and the bread pudding. Both rich and tasty.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"I have to lawyer up a little early in my review this time...http://tinyurl.com/4julqg

Do you miss the simple, twisted genius of Warren Zevon, too?

At any rate, to fully disclose,  I know the owner of WCG personally and businessally...You'll just have to trust me when I tell you that this didn't shade my review...in fact quite the opposite...I have been sitting on this for a while...trying to figure out how write this without sounding like a shill!

Then I thought, ""Well, Donald, everyone is still entitled to my own opinion"" so here we go!

WCG is one of my favorite places in the Greater Phoenix Area for a number of reasons:

* The menu is so varied, creative and well executed...everything from the Mesquite Grilled Artichokes to the Roasted Chicken to the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad and my favorite, the Maytag Burger (more about that in a minute) is well prepared and delicious

* The service has always been first rate (and I have to say that I expected that when the server is aware that I am friends with Bobby, but there are ton of people there that don't know me from Tyler Florence and we still get great service!)

* Extraordinary care in the preparation of the food, from the grinding of the beef for my burger to the grilling of the artichokes and the construction of the puff pastry crust Apple Pie for desert...they pay incredible attention to detail

* The atmosphere and ambience remind me (and not by accident) of one of my Northern California favorites, the Rutherford Grill...all cherry tones, leather and soft lighting...it always puts me in a great mood and compels me to eat more than I should

Today was no different...The Beautiful Carin and I stopped in for a lunch meeting to discuss our business, our branding, goal setting for the company (is world domination within 48 months too lofty a goal?) and what not (I set foot in this Northern California inspired place and I start to sound like Ah-nold again and so forth).

For my lunch, I had one of the best burgers in town...the Maytag Burger...they grind the meat on the premises, daily, fresh...no kidding!

For the ""Maytag"" portion of this earthly delight, they bake and crumble the bacon into the Maytag Bleu Cheese (notice my fancy French spelling there...merci') and form it into a disk of cheese and bacon that they drop onto the burger a few seconds before it's done and voila'...the best bacon/bleu cheese burger around...bacon and cheese in every bite...genius!

Carin has her favorites, too...the Filet Mignon Cobb Salad is one, as is the Spit Roasted Chicken and some of the best Crab Cakes you'll find west of Baltimore.

I smile every time I walk into WCG...I smile even more (and I usually burp a little, too) when I walk out after another great meal!

But don't take my word for it (another disclaimer to end my review on the right note)...go see for yourself...and try the Apple Pie...you'll be happy you did (and quite possibly burping in delight, as well).",5,"[u' own opinion', u' favorite places', u' great service', u' incredible attention', u' great mood', u' great meal', u' right note']",4.685714286,[u' twisted genius'],-0.5

The atmosphere was nice, bar looked very nice with all the bottles lined up as a back drop. We sat in the dining room and ordered a bottle of wine. One good thing about this restaurant is that any server will act like your server. The servers were very helpful overall. We ordered a bottle of Chardonnay and Caprese ($5.99 - Fresh tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese in a balsamic reduction) and a side of Israeli Couscous ($2.79 - topped with roasted pistachios) to start. Both were good, the only thing is that the Caprese was 75% tomatoes and 25% mozzarella, I guess that is why it is only $5.99, but it was good. I am a vegetarian so I ordered the Famous Grilled Chicken Salad ($14.89 - Field greens tossed with sliced grilled chicken, goat cheese, toasted almonds, golden raisins, cherry tomatoes and croutons in an aged balsamic vinaigrette drizzled with yogurt sauce) WITHOUT chicken (of course!) and I loved it. I asked for avocados and extra goat cheese to substitute for the chicken and they brought both without charge. My boyfriend got the Rustic Club Sandwich ($10.89 - Marinated turkey, roasted and sliced with smoky bacon, cheddar, lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise on toasted whole wheat bread). His only critique of the sandwich its that it was too heavy to enjoy with the entire meal (apps, wine, dessert) He found himself at the end to be lethargic. Great overall sandwich but a little too heavy for his taste. Even though we were both stuffed we decided to order dessert since that is what this whole restaurant is about...white chocolate! We  ordered White Chocolate Banana Cream Pie ($7.59 - A Graham Cracker and Chocolate Chunk Crust, Fresh Bananas and Vanilla Pastry Cream. With Caramel, Whipped Cream and Shaved White Chocolate) and I was actually expecting it to be really really good. But it was not that tasty, kind of bland.

We did not get a reservation and just walked in around 9pm hoping that we'd get a table right away since they are an hour away from closing time. Parking wasn't bad, location was easy to find, and the restaurant's ambiance was relaxing and I would say it's more for ""date night"" kind of restaurant instead of a family style restaurant. We were surprised that it took 20 minutes to get us a table because the restaurant didn't look so packed at all. 

When we finally got our table, our server was trying hard to be polite but he gave us a vibe that he was tired and ready to go home which I totally understand. 

We ordered different entrees to give each a try, I ordered the black seasoned Mahi with fresh mashed potatoes and I thought that was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the chicken enchiladas which he also enjoyed. We also tried the roasted chicken and bbq ribs and thought those were a little dry and not as savory than expected. And finally, my sister ordered a cheeseburger with a side of french fries which she also thought was ""okay"" and nothing special about it. 

Each dish costs about $18-24 which makes me think the food would be extravagant and something that I have never tasted anywhere else before but I think for this price range, it did not meet my expectation.

Overall I think we had an ""okay"" experience but no really looking forward to going back.",3,"[u' great reviews', u"" n't bad""]",1.15,[],0

I had a side Caesars salad and it was really good and plenty big.  My friend had the salmon and couscous and he said it was ""good"" but not outstanding.   I had the ""rib steak"" but it was really small, tough (like shoe leather)  and certainly not worth the $27.95.  It had a strange tasting sauce on top as well.  The shoe string potatoes were only warm on the plate.  We ordered apply pie but when it came, it was more of an apple danish with puff pastry.  it tasted good but it wasn't an apple pie.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"We have enjoyed The White Chocolate Grill (WCG) many times, both for Happy Hour and for dinner. Our experiences have been universally good.

We came here last week after church for Easter Sunday around 2-ish for dinner.  We had made our reservations on Open Table/Yelp and our booth was waiting for us when we arrived.  Actually, the WCG was only half full at the time after a busy brunch, but it was nice having the hostess escort us over to our table by the window.

Our water glasses were filled, as we sat looking at our menus.  Heather our server came by giving us the Specials of the day.  The three of us decided to skip the wine list, opting instead for Ice Tea.  It had already been a long day, and any alcohol would have put us to sleep.

We started by sharing the Ahi Tuna Salad for $14.95.  WCG normally sears it with a sesame crust which is very good, but today we asked them not to cook it but serve it raw.  There is something about raw ahi tuna, in their champagne vinaigrette that speaks to me.  Today was no different, it was very nicely done.

For dinner we order, the End Cut Prime Rib for $24.99, the Baby Back Rib for $21.99, and the Balsamic Rib Eye for $26.89.  Each of us had a bite of the others and we were very happy with our selections.  

The Rib Eye was not what you would have expected, in so far as it was not a piece of prime rib without the bone, but instead two small 7' cutlets cooked in a glazed balsamic reduction sauce.  Very nice.   The Baby Backs were as you would expect, as was the End Cut.

For dessert, we ordered the Bread Pudding for $7.59 and the house special Silky Chocolate Soufflé Cake also $7.59.  We also had some coffee for $2.49 and a Cappuccino for $2.99.

In my Yelp Tip, I mentioned the Bread Pudding as being exceptional and it is,  I know on some cooking shows, it looks like just day old bread and a cream sauce of some kind.  But at WCG, the sauce is almost Creme Brulle-ish and it really is out of this world.  

The total damage came to $116.00, before tax of $10.79 and tip; which seemed fair for three people.  One of things we like to do is go to a movie at the nearby Harkin's Cine Capri and stop at WCG for dessert afterwards.  We really had a nice time at the WCG on Easter and we will certainly recommend them.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,Love this place!! the Parmesan crusted fillet is to die for!! I've tried other restaurants fillets and its just not the same. The hubby loves the french dip and just like me he hasn't found a better french dip out there. We love their string fries and the ranch is really good. Not a fan of the cesar salad however we both loved the spring rolls for appetizers. For dessert we have pretty much tried them all. My favorite is the banana cream pie but they are all pretty yummy. The waiters and staff is just amazing. about a year ago when we came for dinner i was brought a mushroom fillet instead of the Parmesan crusted fillet... i didn't mind but they were awesome and comped my meal and brought out the Parmesan that goes on top so i can have it with the stake they already gave me.(we were in a hurry so i didnt want to wait for another one) A couple of months after that we went again and we had a horrible experience wait for our table/service and food was just horrible. We came there just for dessert and i need to mention that it was not busy at all. we were never asked for our drink order until waiting about 5-10 minutes after we sat down when i asked a manager for assistance. by the time he got our drinks our waitress finally came to ask for our order (she must have been on break as we didn't see her anywhere in the room) then it took what it seemed like forever to get our 4 different types of desserts. By the time we left i was very very disappointed. But i guess the last few times we have been this year we have had great customer service.

UE3AvVnaPEBPneVahYT2eA,"This would have been a one star review except the incredible management which comped our meal. Let me preface by saying we came here from a very poor experience in Tucson. Literally drove back home and decided to hop by for a meal end dessert, hoping to override a poor experience we'd just had.
Well, unfortunately, it was ""not my day"" for dining, and our experience here was pretty aweful. As I said, we stopped in for dessert. We were seated in surprisingly short time, considering the line and proposed ""20-minute"" wait. However, despite our short wait, we were in there for 45 minutes. Yes, 45 minutes, for dessert. That is how much I ususally spend if I am chatty with friends for an entire meal.
A friendly waitress greeted us and took our drink orders (Some Cherry Coke to compliment) We then waited quite some time for our ""official"" waitress to come, and when she got there, she did not smile, say thank you for coming, or anything. We gave her our order and asked for a side of grenadine to make the cherry coke stronger. She obliged the grenadine and ran off with our order. We were not attended to until the dessert came out. I would have waited an hour for good, fresh, and warm dessert, but alas after about 10 minutes they came out. The White brownie dessert was cold, the other lukewarm. When she brought us a second cherry coke (which had no extra grenadine, despite the fact I had to order some earlier) My twin got her attention and said ""It's cold"".  She did not say ""I'm so sorry"" she just said ""Ok"" and snatched, literally, the dessert from the table. She asked me if mine was too, I said it could use a little warmth, she took them both back. NO APOLOGY, no NOTHING. We waited another 10 or 15 minutes, and got warm dessert. DURING THIS ENTIRE TIME she talked and checked on the table across from us NONSTOP. We had to sit around with no soda, and had had the cold dessert for some time. We were relieved when they came back out perfectly warm, although there was more dark chocolate sauce on the white brownie this time. They were delightful! Finally, she checked on us, brought our bill again and I asked for a to-go for my bread pudding. I watched this woman bring out 5 other tables dishes, two to go boxes, and chat with the table opposite us 3 times. We were waiting for her also to take the card. FINALLY she came over, by this time I muttered ""about time"" under my breath, thats how long it was! Another someodd minutes and we finally had the bill back. We were angry, we loved the food, but this woman had not SERVED us, so I wrote a big ZERO where the tip was. It would be different if she'd smiled at least ONCE or apologized for being so busy or had a good attitude, but this woman had a big frown the whole time. So we asked for a manager to tell them about this. She comped our meal, even though we were perfectly happy paying for the food and not the service. The food was delightful. I was very grateful for the dessert meal comp, but I will never go back again. This was pretty aweful in service. It should never take 45 minutes to get and eat a dessert. Period. It wouldnt be worth going back.",2,"[u' incredible management', u' pretty aweful', u' friendly waitress', u' warm dessert', u' warm dessert', u' perfectly warm', u' good attitude', u' perfectly happy', u' pretty aweful']",5.075,"[u' very poor', u' poor experience', u' so sorry', u' little warmth', u' cold dessert', u' dark chocolate']",-2.3575

Ld2hhA3q3cdkptwS1fsYEg,"The food at Yogis Grill is pretty good and decently priced.  I like the idea that you can get half of a sushi roll.  The lunch special is nicely priced and, in my opinion, a good value.  However, sometimes the chicken is undercooked (as it was today) or includes a tough, chewy part of the chicken.  I had the same combination bowl lunch special for lunch the other day and with the exception of one piece, the rest of the chicken was cooked appropriately.  So yeah, sometimes hit or miss.  I've had the crunch roll which was tasty and nicely priced for fast sushi.  

There is ample seating, but service can be rather slow.  It was a given that the sushi roll I ordered took longer to prepare than the lunch special I ordered.  However, the slow service started at the register.  I visited around noon during a weekday.  The line wasn't that long at the register so I was looking forward to ordering quickly.  After the cashier took the order from the customer in front of me, the cashier answered to phone to take a phone order.  The phone order was a long one and I ended up waiting for a long time as the cashier insisted that the phone order was more important than mine.  I almost got out of line and left, but she must've sensed my annoyance and took my order while she put the phone order on hold.  Service would have been more quick is there was more than one person at the register and taking phone orders, especially during the peak of the lunch hour.  

They have a wide variety of food, but I will definitely think twice about ordering here.  The amount of time I have to available to wait for my order and the potential quality of the food (whether I feel like taking a chance on undercooked chicken) will be factors I take into consideration.",2,"[u' pretty good', u' good value', u' fast sushi', u' more important']",1.825,"[u' wide variety', u' undercooked chicken']",-0.7

This being our first time, it took some time for us to decide what to order. The cashier was pleasant and didn't make us feel rushed. I ordered the cucumber salad. My friend ordered a teriyaki bowl along with some dumplings for us to share. The food came out fairly quickly. The salad was brought out first then the other items. 

The salad was disappointing. It looked nothing like the picture on the menu board. It was a lot of iceberg lettuce topped with strips of cucumber and a couple small cherry tomatoes. A small plastic container of salad dressing came on the side per my request. The dumplings were good, but a bit greasy for my taste. My friend thought the teriyaki bowl was okay.

There was really nothing about the food that stood out. It was average food that could be found at any Asian cookie cutter franchise. 

Not sure why everything is in styrofoam or plastic. No dishes that way, but it didn't add to the experience. I didn't like that dining in meant I ate my salad out of a plastic container with a plastic fork.

With two exceptions: I went with the spicy teriyaki sauce and low carb style (and extra 99 cents). I also opted for the regular not large size.

The spicy teriyaki is sweet, tangy, and spicy. Loved it. Chicken had a nice flavor, char marks, and was tender (next time I would opt to thrown down the extra 99 cents for all white meat just to keep it leaner). When you go for the low carb/protein style they give steamed but still crunchy (in a good way) cabbage with carrots and broccoli. They garnish is with green onions and thrown so extra sauces in the bag. I really enjoyed it and I feel so full!

But then one evening, I reaaaaaaaally wanted a teriyaki bowl. Since there aren't many options, I decided to give Yogi's another shot. This time, I was impressed! It does sometimes take a little time for your order to be ready, but I'm sure that's because everything is being made fresh, so I don't mind. 

The teriyaki chicken is tender and fairly lean, the rice is perfect and the sauce is great. The only thing I don't like is the sliced scallions they garnish with. I usually don't like raw onions of any sort. I'm a quasi sushi fan, and all the rolls I've had have been great.

I think they should be equally as good but did not feel that way. I though this may have been a one off but I returned a second time and they were consistent with their same portions which did not compare to the one on Camelback.

  I assumed this place would be like Samurai Sam's after seeing the Yelp pictures. I was wrong.

 Since I was already wrong, and my boyfriends friend said she always got the chicken/beef teriyaki bowl, I figured I must go with that choice. Let's do it.

Then I see that they have spicy teriyaki sauce. I'm a sucker for anything spicy. Make that shit as spicy as you can.

The super upbeat and friendly staff (order-taker and cook) directed us to the condiment station that had one of those new fancy 100000+ combo coke machines, and told us they had free extra teriyaki sauce in the ketchup-style pump thing. I grabbed one, and didn't even need to use it.

The chicken was nice and crispy, juicy, and flavorful. I was actually shocked at how good it was. This is the best teriyaki chicken I have had at any restaurant. 

The beef was good. Wasn't as good as the chicken though. The chicken stole the show. Beef was a little too thin after being spoiled by the perfectly prepared  chicken.
 
I had egg rolls, they were standard (like panda express type) and delicious. Remember, I'm picky, I like simple things. 

My boyfriend had the California rolls and ate every bite. He's as picky as me (if not worse) but grew up in Hawaii so has a slight different preference in taste as I do (an AZ native who doesn't eat any seafood). 

I loved this place. I was pleasantly surprised by the food quality, the attitude from the young man taking orders & the woman who seemed to be cooking/delivering your food, and cleanliness of this restaurant. I will be returning. Thank you

They have sushi, beef and chicken among other stuff. I was a little scare to try it but after deciding to give it a shot I was amazed with the taste and quality of their food. What I like the most from this place is that everything is made from scratch, unlike panda express or other Asian restaurant where they have pre-made food sitting in the hot window. However, they are very fast at cooking your dish. Yes, they might take time to cook your chicken or sushi during rushing hours but they will ensure your food is cooked perfectly. In addition, they provide take-out. 

After driving a couple minutes throughout the Norterra plaza, I decided to try out Yogi's Grill because I was craving some chicken and rice. This place is not in a strategic area because it is hidden in a corner between Best Buy and Chipotle. After my first visit, this place became my to-go restaurant for a week. I would give them 6 stars if I could. The place is very clean and organized. The bathrooms are shiny clean. They have a Coke soda machine that I have never seen before in my life. It's touch electronic soda machine that provides you a wide variety of coke products. 

During my first visit I was a little confused in what to order, the cashier approached me and asked me if I needed any suggestions. She showed me to go menu with all the food options. I finally decided to try the Large Chicken Teriyaki Bowl. I'm not a huge fan of teriyaki sauce, but their sauce is exceptional. The white rice texture was very smooth, it felt like it just came up from the crockpot. The chicken was very tender and juice. The bowl will fill you up because they provide you with large portions, you can even eat for lunch for the next day. I was very pleased with my choice.
 
The restaurant is a family owned restaurant, they run the business as well. The staff members are very friendly, they are always smiling at you. The cashier takes your order as well as she delivers the food to your table, always with a smile. They meticulously take your food order and ask you if you want all the garnishes they put in. 

One thing I would complain about and this is not an issue is the layout of the place. During lunch hours from 11:00 am - 2:00 pm they have lunch specials. Combos from $8-10 including a drink. The place fills up very quickly, so you have to get there early in order to get a table, if not you will be sharing tables with other people, which I don't mind.

This place has the best breakfast  burrito I ever have tasted. Miss Irma is so gracious and kind:) you can taste it from her food. Here's the 5 reason why this place should be supported.

1. Locally owned. Heart warming welcome when you get to the door.
2. Clean. Let me emphasize that, very clean. Just check their staff wearing gloves when they serve you:)
3. Price. That price. Check the pictures:) 3.99 for a burrito!
4. Presentation, for a small place their presentation is very impressive.
5. The flavor. Just come and try. 

Iam so sure youll like this place that iam willing to  pay your food if you don't like it. For Less than 5 bucks and you'll have a new place to eat.

:) the place is small and in a very hard to find. But I tell you. The trip to this place is worth it. 

Again less than 10 bucks for a great food. So great I am pretty sure you'll like it.

Don't take that negatively, Irma's is the kind of tiny, family run place that give's ""hole in the wall""  a good name.   
  
A friendly greeting from Irma welcomed me to the tiny establishment, home of numerous previous eateries in same space near intersection of 15th Avenue, Grand and Roosevelt. The name is ""Irma's Kitchen"" although one of the exterior signs also says ""Irma's Mexican and American Food"".  The writing, as in the menu, is literally on the wall at Irma's.  The American part consisting of French toast and pancakes at breakfast, hamburgers, ham & cheese sandwiches, and I'm sure another item or two I missed but shouldn't have, considering the entire menu is painted quite neatly on the walls before me.

The curtained  windows and touch or two of simple wall decor give a personal touch and warmth to the dining area furnished with simple tables and chairs.  As to the food  I can only say my single ham & cheese & potato breakfast burrito, was truly best in class of similar tried at a good number of establishments, not dry, truly tasty, of generous size and quite filling, but not the overwhelming full-grown dachshund size burrito served at some establishments (which are fine, but just a bit too much and too heavy for my appetite and tastes most of the time).  If everything on the menu is as good, you can count this place as ""a find"".  And affordable?  As of this date, March 14, 2015, this cost a paltry $3.99+ tax. 

I look forward to going back and trying more of the writing on the wall, and at the prices listed, feel I can afford to.

1JF9TbJ2d5hH8xsQvvklHg,"Before I delve any further, here's what I'll be conveying in this review.  5 stars for the food.  1 star for the dining experience.  Depending on how you weigh those two things, you may come up with a different number of stars than I did.  And how you define the ""dining experience"" can of course be wide open to interpretation.  But I'll give you the full rundown on my experience and you can judge for yourself.  But just to reiterate, the food itself is awesome and a great value, so much of what I'll be sharing will echo some of the earlier Yelp reviews of Irma's.

I came here on a Sunday morning, excited by what the Yelpers were saying about this place (particularly for breakfast).  Its a tiny space (room for maybe 20 inside and 4 outside) with a tiny amount of parking (maybe 4-5 spots).  When I arrived around 8:30am the place was fairly busy, but I was able to get a small table for myself.  The young man working the front (didn't catch his name) was super courteous and took my drink order not long after I arrived (I asked for a horchata) and gave me a complimentary chips and salsa.  For whatever reason it took about 5 minutes for him to bring out my drink order.  During that time was when things got dicey.  The place is small which means if you're dining inside you're right next to the kitchen itself.  And from the time I arrived to the time I got my drink the kitchen got super smokey, to the point where the smoke was literally billowing out into the dining area.  By the time I got my horchata (which was delicious by the way), I was almost choking on the smoke.  Two customers moved to the outside tables to escape the smoke and I was about to follow suit when the head cook finally opened the windows to air out the building.  About 5 minutes later, the air was breathable again.  Nevertheless, the restaurant remained smokey (though at least tolerably so from then on), which makes me wonder what they'll do in the summer when its too hot to pop open a window or sit outside.  Yikes.  Bottomline, if you're coming here for the first time, my recommendation would be to play it safe and sit outside (if its cool enough) or get your order to go.  At least until they figure out how to solve the borderline dangerous air circulation problem here.

Now then, let's get to the good part.  The food.  Based on the food photos and the prices here I had assumed that I would need to order two dishes just to come away full and happy from this place.  After all, there can't possibly be that much food on a plate for just $4, right?  I decided to go with an order of chilaquiles (Christmas style) and a breakfast burrito.  Total cost for the food, horchata, free chips and salsa, tax and tip came to about $13.  For that cheap, I expected a pair of dishes light on portions.  

Whoops.  The breakfast burrito was huge and stuffed with eggs, bacon and potatoes.  I added a little hot sauce to boot.  This alone would've left me plenty satisfied.  But a few seconds later, out came a big plate of chilaquiles (basically fried tortilla strips covered in red or green sauce, or both in my case) with eggs your way (I got scrambled), rice, beans, and lettuce.  It wasn't too spicy, but great flavors all around with just a little kick.  There was no way I was gonna finish it all and I happily took some home to finish at lunch.  And all that for just $13?  Ridiculously good deal.

So there it is.  Great food and drink.  Great value.  The restaurant itself?  That leaves much to be desired.  Like I said, the young man who served me was courteous but slow and the air circulation was bad enough that I would not recommend dining inside.  If you're coming here for take out or to dine outside while the weather is good, please do.  But come summertime, takeout may be the only way to go here.",3,"[u' full rundown', u' great value', u' complimentary chips', u' super smokey', u' too hot', u' good part', u' away full', u' free chips', u' hot sauce', u' great flavors', u' Ridiculously good', u' Great food']",6.033333333,"[u' small table', u' dangerous air', u' little kick']",-1.0375

1JF9TbJ2d5hH8xsQvvklHg,"With a very early flight to Phoenix, we were hungry upon arrival and so I Yelped breakfast burritos and found many positive reviews of a small place a little off the beaten path in Phoenix called Irma's Kitchen.  We had a great time and a great breakfast here!  It only has a few tables and we were there early in the morning around 7:45 AM, and for the short time we were there, several familiar loyal local customers came in, so you can tell this place has a following.  Authentic Mexican food and we always like to go to local restaurants when we travel.  The service was great, we were greeted warmly by both Irma and our server, who got us water and took our coffee order immediately.  The breakfast burrito was what my wife was there for, and I got the chilaquiles.  Both were excellent.  The burrito was not too spicy, so my wife liked that, it had eggs, ham and potato (maybe bacon?) and the tortilla itself was really tasty, let alone the ingredients inside of it.  I tried it, and I liked it too.  My chilaquiles were excellent as well, in fact I liked that the tortilla pieces at the bottom were not all soggy like they sometimes are when I get this dish elsewhere.  They still had a little bit of crunch to them.  You can get them with either red or green sauce, and I went with green and it was great, it didn't overwhelm the dish at all and complemented it really well.  The eggs were right over top of the rest of the dish, and I liked that you could break the yolk and let it drip into the rest of the dish and combine it all.  VERY tasty dish! 

We found Irma charming, a really nice personable woman who cares about her cooking and her customers.  And we spoke to a man (I don't want to assume it's her husband, because I don't know that) and he was great, too.  Lunch and dinner menu looked great, by the way, as well.  We just really enjoyed the entire dining experience overall, the food itself, the service, and the interaction with the staff.  We will definitely return to Irma's when back in Phoenix.

Irma's is a very small restaurant with maybe 4 or 5 small tables (4 tops at most).

The salsa that comes with fresh chips is different from any other I've had, it almost looks like chicken soup, yellowish, clear and very flavorful. I had the chicken fajitas, which came with a giant flour tortilla that was as hot as hades. The chicken breast pieces (not cheaper thigh meat) were large and perfectly cooked through yet juicy and tender. Squash, onions and peppers add to the fajita mix.

Rice and refried beans and an apple slice with grapefruit slice on shredded lettuce fill out the plate. I was stuffed when I finished and there was no way I was going to leave anything this good on the plate! All that and a refillable fountain soda for less than $10.00.

Let's start talking about the food first. I got the pancakes. He got the breakfast burrito, chicken soup. Irma came out with chips and salsa and they were HELLA good. You could taste the freshness of the tomatoes and the chips were perfectly crisp with a sprinkle of salt on top. My bf didn't take too long to finish it and Irma got him seconds. The chicken soup was also amazing, the chicken was tender and the broth was also very flavorful. I thought the burrito was amazing too but my bf thought it was a little too salty (I just think he was too full to enjoy it fully). I don't think I've ever wanted to praise a tortilla before. It was cheesy and every bite was a burst of flavor in my mouth. I think my American breakfast was ok, not too memorable. I would definitely go for the Mexican stuff next time we're here.

The price is ridiculously cheap. The total for us was about $16. We got three dishes and a coffee. Even with a generous tip that's less than $25. They also take card (they even take Amex).

In a day and age where it seems like premium food is sold at a premium cost, Irma's kitchen challenges that notion! With a $4 tip, my meal of a burrito, Coke and chips and salsa (free) came out to $12; you can't beat that! On top of the price, the staff is priceless. I'm not sure if the lady working the counter was Irma herself or not but she was incredibly friendly. She was giving out free samples of a lemonade recipe she had created that included jalapeno peppers and it was unlike anything else I've ever had.

The food offerings are great too! Not only does it offer all your Wendy's favorites, but they also have fresh baked goods. This includes cookies brownies, pieces of pie, and rolls. Want to spice up the taste of your soft drink? This is the place to do it! They offer coke products, but you can choose a variety of flavors to add, like cherry, peach, orange, raspberry or vanilla. I chose to have my usual ice tea with Splenda while my husband picked Raspberry Coke. It was enjoyed immensely!

Both of us ordered our favorite burgers, the baconator. He likes to add  tomato and extra cheese. I prefer mine with mustard, ketchup and pickle only. What happens at this point determined the three star rating. His burger did not have extra cheese which of course costs extra. 

We take the receipt up to the counter and are immediately told that it does have extra cheese. By looking at my burger, we can tell this is not true. My husband goes up to the counter again, and this time he is handed a cold  piece of cheese on a disposable tray. He decides to help me eat before returning a third time!

This time the manager asks what the problem is. We explain that he added tomato and extra cheese. She says, ""did they not add tomato?"" If you looked at the sandwich with tomato and the slice of unmelted cheese, the tomato was obviously not the issue. Finally, she put two and two together and remade his sandwich. She also reminded the employees that they cook the burgers to order and gave me a free chocolate frosty for the inconvenience!

gkIyPrNGpF4EGqoYWe2KBQ,"This Wendy's is one of the newly remodeled editions here in the Valley. Like at least one other that I've visited, the new decor inside is pretty impressive. If you've ever been to a Wendy's, you know that the decor really hasn't changed much over the decades. Those days, however, are officially over.

The most prominent of all of the changes is the faux fireplace with the lounge seating area. There are four lowboy lounge chairs surrounding two small tables seating in front of the fireplace, with a nice HD television mounted on the wall above. It LOOKS really nice. But, as I stayed a little while, I noticed how uncomfortable these chairs appeared to be for every patron who sat in them. 

Being that the chairs are low, and clearly built for relaxation rather than function, there doesn't appear to be any comfortable way to sit in them while eating your food. The seat portion is quite deep, allowing you to appear like you're reclining. However, that particular position is not conducive to comfortable eating. Every time a patron wanted to take a bite, they had to awkwardly make their way back to the edge of the chair to get back to their food. From there, the customers didn't have any back support. Plus, if you're a tall person, your knees are guaranteed to be up in your chest while you're leaning forward to get to your food. If you're a child or a smaller person, your legs are going to dangle off of the edge, as the cushion is so deep. It's truly a Catch 22 sitting in these seats to dine. As a lounge, though, it's quite nice.

My family and I managed to get a much more comfortable seat at one of the bar-style high tops located around the many floor-to-ceiling windows. It gave us a great opportunity to see what a train wreck the parking lot at this particular location can be. This day happened to be particularly crowded, it seemed. Every time somebody tried to pull out of their parking spot, they had to wait for what seemed like five minutes before there was a clearing. The way this parking lot is designed, if you take a left out of the drive-thru and go back around the building, you're pretty much screwed. You'll end up fighting people trying to get INTO the drive-thru, as well as the people trying to leave the parking lot to get out altogether. So, a word to the wise, turn right out of the drive-thru.

At its core, it's still a Wendy's. There are a few new additions to the menu, but it's pretty much the same old same old. If you do visit this remodeled version of Wendy's, try to go during an off-peak time. That way, you can avoid the general chaos that ensues when this place is at capacity.",3,"[u' pretty impressive', u' really nice', u' comfortable way', u' comfortable eating', u' more comfortable', u' great opportunity', u' pretty much', u' pretty much']",3.725,[u' small tables'],-0.25
gkIyPrNGpF4EGqoYWe2KBQ,"After reviewing the Starship McDonald's up in Flag last week, I noticed I forgot to post my review of this Next Generation fast food place from three months ago. D'oh!

Wow!  You have to give Wendy's credit for thinking outside the box.  This fast food restaurant is like no other I've been to. As some of my photos can attest, this is more of a comfy chair club with a lot of eye distractions than fast food chain with plastic chairs. For instance, it has a huge flat screen HDTV blasting ESPN's Sports Center that is situated above a faux fireplace. ""A"" for effort!

This Wendy's also has a coffee/barista station.  Though the ""Joe"" tastes more like a water down Seattle Best. Too bad they couldn't get a Tim Horton's contract, eh!  Also new, is the Coca-Cola brand soda dispensers that tends to make everything taste like Dr Pepper.  So if you are from Texas, this might be a good thing. LOL

As for the food, Wendy's continues to let the corporate kitchen rethink their menu items.  The food is very good and it will be interesting to see where they go with it after a couple of years.

The atmosphere is modern and matches the neighborhood.

When I placed my order, only one person was working the cash register, pizza oven and cleaning tables.  It was chaotic, but understood since it was around 4:00 p.m. and the dinner crew had not started.  I had ordered a margherita pizza, cheese pizza and salad.  The salad came out first, followed by the cheese pizza.  I waited for my margherita pizza.  The sole worker in the restaurant forgot about it and the pizza was partially burnt.  He gave me the pizza, apologized and cooked me a replacement pizza at no cost.  Both pizzas were good, albeit the first one had some burnt areas that needed to be discarded.

After 30 minutes another two employees came into the restaurant and the flow of traffic and cleanup improved.

The menu stays basic - they want to extend the concept of a build your own pizza by keeping the overall menu short. They seem to post the most popular pizza combinations to give you an idea but they also have a list of their ingredients available for you to peruse and create your own. 

Staff was super friendly and willing to help and answer any questions we had. We like it when people work their creative juices with food so we let one of the pizza makers (Joseph?) do his thang and create his own recommended pizza. If I remember correctly there was several meats, red sauce, mushrooms, and tomatoes (I may be one or two ingredients off). In any case, the pizza came out piping hot in about 10-12 mins and was pretty darn delicious!  My non-appetite suddenly perked up with the smells coming from the box. Despite it being 9pm we gobbled that up quick.  We also bought a soda because the owner suggested something awesome - why not get root beer and go next door to Zoyo for the vanilla froyo to make a root beer float?  

GENIUS.  We did as we were told and it was a nice addition to our meal. Did we also go get froyo afterward?  Duh. Why not?  They make it easy peasy and it's really the intention of the partnership - have dinner, then have dessert.  Sold.

I sent my boyfriend within ten mins to go pick our dinner up. When he arrived, the front counter attendant couldn't find our pizza; leaving Joe to wait an additional thirty mins or so. (He was at the correct location) The attendant then handed my boyfriend TWO pizzas. Clearly, not our order!!  After finding what they thought was our pie based on the ingredient selection, it was luke warm at best and had a sticker for a different client and phone number.

They can't find my house. It's not hard to find, I swear. It's a piece of cake, and a stone's throw from a major crossroad. They had once taken two hours to deliver a pizza, saying they tried to call me (they didn't), only to return to the store and bring it back once I called. Naturally, I was delivered a lukewarm pizza, but in the nicest way possible was told that it was *my* mistake.  Unacceptable, in the age of online ordering and GPS systems in our phones, there is no excuse for getting lost in what is essentially a three mile drive in a straight line. 

Without complaining, I had received a coupon for a free large pizza. Apology accepted. Upon visiting the store, I got to keep the card *after* ordering because they gave me the wrong toppings. Suckers.

Also, they always take longer than the ETA, even in the middle of a weekday. Even now, I am waiting 70 minutes for a 30-40 minute order, and when I had called 15 minutes ago, was told it was on its way, but that construction was holding it up. Yes, there is construction, but you have taken this long in the past without it. Also, construction would not explain why it takes nearly an hour to produce one large pizza. I even tip nicely.

I enjoy Papa John's pizza, but unless my complaints are addressed, I will never order from this location again. I will encourage my friends to follow suit. RAWR.",1,[],0,[u' wrong toppings'],-0.5

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"Had heard some good things about Marigold Maison and decided to check it out on a Sunday evening. 

We had a reservation at 6 and were able to get seated right as the place was about to get slammed. First thing you walk in, there is no host station and you have to just hope one of the staff members will approach you to get your table. Once we sat down it was roughly a 10-15 minute wait until we were greeted. They gave us our menus and then after about another 10 minutes they dropped off 2 waters for 3 people. Eventually everyone was able to get their own beverage and we ordered appetizers. 

We started off with the Garlic Naan and Chicken Dip. The Garlic Nan was light and airy with a crisp finish. Really enjoyed it with the Chicken Dip. The dip itself was flavorful and the chicken was prepared nicely. It was a really good start to the meal from a food perspective.

For our entrees we had the Saag Spinach with shrimp, Chicken Curry and Chicken Tikka. The Saag Spinach had a nice spice to it and a velvety texture. It combined savory flavor with the spice and went well with the rice they provided. The shrimp were cooked perfectly, big and juicy. The naan also went well with this dish as the saag has a stew-like consistency. 

Chicken Curry is one of the first dishes I picture when thinking about Indian food and we were not disappointed. This was also a very spicy dish as we requested but the spice did not overwhelm the other flavors. The chicken fit in perfectly and was also accompanied by rice. The dish as a whole was very impressive and the spice blend was second to none. 

The Chicken Tikka is essentially a whole roasted chicken with dark and white meat. We got a side of hot sauce for the chicken which was laid upon a bed of sautéed vegetables. The hot sauce lived up to its name and was a great compliment to the chicken which was dusted in an array of spices. The chicken was juicy on the inside and had crispy skin. It is also a good sized portion. 

The food was really good and it was ashame that the service was so bad. Drink refills were not done without multiple requests, and while they were busy, its not an excuse to just ignore your tables. But it wasn't reserved just for us, the table directly next to us did not see a server for at least 20 minutes and had to actually grab their own menus. 

With the food being so good I was willing to overlook the bad service but things got even worse. Upon paying the bill, the server hovered over us as we attempted to sign the check. Right as we set the pen down after signing the check, we were told to leave. The quote I believe was ""we are really busy and need you to leave right now."" It took me a moment to process that we were being kicked out of the restaurant due to their inability to handle good business. I grew up in the restaurant business and have held a variety of roles and had never seen nor heard of guests being told to leave the moment they sign the bill in order to get another table sat. At most we just wanted to take a moment to relax and finish our beverages but we obliged as I knew if I stayed any longer I would have had to say something about being treated like that. 

I can forgive inattentiveness when a restaurant is busy, but blatant disrespect is another thing. Its a shame as the entire party enjoyed the food but we all agreed that that was our first and last visit to the Marigold Maison if you are kicked out of the restaurant the moment you pay your bill. 

The two stars is out of respect to the efforts of the kitchen staff which were impressive.",2,"[u' good things', u' seated right', u' own beverage', u' really good', u' nice spice', u' very impressive', u' hot sauce', u' hot sauce', u' great compliment', u' really good', u' own menus', u' so good', u' good business']",7.885714286,"[u' so bad', u' bad service', u' blatant disrespect']",-1.9

Sour, spicy with a great texture that sticks to the naan and rice which, at least for me, is just the perfect size for an evening curry.

Add in Naan a cut above those poor thin uniform excuses that are the feature of most valley buffets  and a decent appetizer section  and I can no longer claim there's not a decent Indian restaurant within 10 miles of the house.  Again this is just based on one dish but that's really all I need. I really wanted to try a bunch of the appetizers but I could see $40 lunch occurring and  that just wasn't a today thing.

Great service, bit pricey for  solo lunch dining and the tables for 2 , tiny,wee bit cramped, though not relevant at the time I was there.

 The lunch menu is too restrictive ,the leap from lunch price to dinner will limit how much I could spend, but don't get me wrong this dish is worth the price,  but 1/2 the serving and a 1/2 naan for $10-12 would hit the sweet spot and make this a regular rather than occasional thing.",4,"[u' great texture', u' perfect size', u' sweet spot']",2.15,"[u' thin uniform', u' not relevant']",-0.6

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"Marigold Maison is a wonderful magical place.  A small little patch of heaven in an area that is far to commercialized, strip mall laden, and devoid of unique mom and pop operations.

There are quite a few options for Indian food in the valley and I am sure there are some that are as good as this wonderful establishment, but I haven't found them yet.

The staff is courteous and professional all while having an air of casual friendliness.  I found the manager (perhaps owner) to be very nice and obviously concerned with the dining experience and the quality of the food.  The restaurant has various specials and events such as their weekly Tuesday ""Date Night"" where you can get a three course meal and a bottle of wine for a very reasonable price.

Let us discuss the food... oh the food.

The tikka masala I had was the best I have had in phoenix.  It was euphoric and could not have been tastier.  For people who understand and love food, there is an ecstasy that certain foods can give you.  A natural high that takes you to a mental place where all the difficulties of the world fade away and all the is left is joy, peace, and deliciousness in your mouth.  I get this feeling with Thai food, Korean BBQ, and the tikka masala from Marigold Maison.

The garlic non was delicious (though our had one edge that was a little burned) and so good.  The rice didn't have saffron but that is understandable given the price range.  But these are small things; things that do nothing to tarnish the luster of excellence that permeates this establishment.

If you love Indian food, love a good deal, and are a hunter of that euphoric food experience, you owe it to yourself to try out Marigold Maison.

First of all the service was impeccable. Our server gave us excellent and honest suggestions on which items to order and how to structure our dinner (some street food options to start then sauced and tandoori entrees to follow). He was knowledgable about the menu and extremely attentive. All of our questions were answered and our water glasses remained filled. 

I recently traveled to South India and I haven't seen Dosa done so true to the authentic way. The coconut chutney was exactly like I had it in India and the Dosa itself was perfectly cooked. I rarely have good shrimp so I was skeptical of the Tandoor shrimp but I was totally wrong. It was tender and teeming with flavor. This is the ""must-get"" item on the menu (another server admitted he eats it every night) We also ordered the Punjabi Bharta (a great vegetarian option) and the eggplant had a perfect smoky flavor to it. The Goan Vindaloo was spicy and very tasty.

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"I learned about this place when they offered a ""lunch only"" Groupon.  When I looked them up I realized they were located at the same address Bombay Spice had recently relocated to in 2014, which means Bombay didn't even last a year.  I went there for lunch yesterday.  Both the waiter and General Manager were very nice and answered several questions.  

I learned that Marigold is owned by the same corporation (JNK Concepts) that owned Bombay.  They have the same chef, but completely different food, menu and pricing.  JNK has multiple restaurants primarily in Phoenix and Chicago.  They also own Roka Akor and Nobuo here in the Phoenix area and still have one Bombay Spice in downtown Chicago.

The restaurant has been upgraded slightly.  You no longer order your food at the counter; they have wait staff.  The prices are considerably higher.

I told both the waiter and GM that I'd not been there before and wanted to be impressed, so asked them what they would suggest, indicating that I was thinking of ordering one of their Thali dishes.  They recommended that I try one of two other dishes which weren't on the lunch menu, but their dinner menu.  I seldom order Dosa because they are usually vegetarian, which I'm not, but I decided to give it a try.  In addition, I specifically wanted to taste their Naan.

There Dosa is called ""Masala Dosa"" which is a crepe filled with potato and onion.  It is served with two sides; Coconut Chutney (the larger bowl) and Sambar.  The crepe looked massive on the plate when it was served, however half of it was filled - the rest was just empty crepe.  The Coconut Chutney was very good, but I wished it had been spicier and there had been more of it.  The filling was OK, but not terrific, however you have to keep in mind, I'm not a vegetarian.  There was very little spice, and in my opinion, taste, in the filling.  There Naan bread was very good, but not the best I've had at some nearby Indian restaurants.

Their service was excellent and the GM was very helpful.  I left with mixed emotions.  The food was good, but I was not as blown away as others appear to be.  I'm sure they use good ingredients and it was well prepared, but to me lacked the kick and taste I would have preferred.  The killer was their prices; considerably higher than most Indian restaurants.  

This Dosa and Naan came to $14.  I'm not a big eater, but the Dosa without the Naan would not have filled me.  Without a coupon I wouldn't go back and pay $14 for what I had.  It probably isn't fair to compare their prices with other places because they claim their meat and fish are a far better quality, and I haven't tried them, but I frequently get either a meat or seafood masala/curry, and Marigold's prices are 25-70% more.  Without additional coupons it is unlikely I'd return, based on price alone.  Their food to me wasn't ""that"" special.

I'm giving them a 3-star overall, but believe their food probably deserves a 4-star, although not for me based on what I had.",3,"[u' very nice', u' very good', u' very good', u' good ingredients']",3.3,"[u' just empty', u' very little', u"" n't fair""]",-0.69375

Good thing because as we were leaving, we found out that the place is their ""family restaurant."" I would venture to guess that translates as they owned the place.

Like spicy? The lamb vindaloo was three alarm in my mouth and very good. Glad we had a couple of orders of naan to cool off. Don't drink water with a mouth fire, tap it down with naan! I also had spoonfuls of some other great dishes and tried to get close to the names on my photos. Next time, I am definitely taking a photo of the menu.

For our entrees we got the Onion Naan Chicken Tikka and the Tandori Shrimp. Again, oh so yummy!!!

The Chicken tikka masala and basmati rice was simply superb as was the lamb curry. Too bad they didn't serve masala dosa at the time.

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"I love Indian food. There, I said it. The problem? There just aren't that many great places here in Phoenix to get it. So when I saw a new Indian place open and get such rave reviews, I was excited. My mom and I decided to meet here for lunch last week. This place was a little hard to find, but it is on the NE corner of Tatum and Cactus (I went to like every other shopping center first... *palm to forehead*) and it faces cactus (by the Olive Garden sort of). When we entered, my first thought was, oh cute... my second thought was... this place is owned by Roka Akor's restaurant group... that's...weird. Anyway, the owner greeted us and that is when things started to get weird. The owner is a talker... he said so himself... and the things he talked about were a little off putting for a restaurant owner... he talked about politics... people walking by the restaurant.... his old chef who stole from him.... karma...you name the awkward conversation topic to have with a stranger, he probably talked about it. I would say this isn't advisable for a restaurant owner... it's not like we came here to hang out with him, we came here to eat.

 Speaking of eating, my mom and I shared a Thali and an order of samosas. I was excited they had Thalis (not many places that I've been here do). The thali is like going to an Indian buffet when you are on a serious diet... you get to taste many items, but just a small amount of each. The Thali consists of 3 'main' dishes - you pick the protein for 2 of them and the third is a mixed veggie curry. They allowed us to mix the lamb vindaloo with the chicken masala (after a little nudging from me and agreeing to pay the higher price - 14$). The lamb was very good, tender, just the right amount of spice. The chicken was also tender, but kind of bland for Indian food.... I guess at dinner you can choose your spice level, but not the case at lunch. The veggies were alright... nothing great, nothing bad. It also came with salad (meh.. salad is salad), two scrawny pieces of plain naan (again... nothing special), rice, and a fried dough ball soaked in sweet syrup (I was kind of sad since reports on here said it used to come with rice pudding... I love rice pudding, the dough ball is just ok). The real star of our meal were the samosas... these things were hot, crispy, and well seasoned. 


Will I be back? Eh, maybe if I were in the area, my mom really enjoyed it, but overall I thought it was just ok and far more expensive (and less delicious) than some of the lunch buffets out there.",3,"[u' great places', u' many items', u' very good', u' right amount', u' sweet syrup', u' just ok', u' just ok', u' less delicious']",4.262380952,"[u' awkward conversation', u' not many', u' serious diet', u' small amount', u' little nudging']",-1.620833333

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"Well, I'm a bit confused. And I got the feeling they were too. The article I read in the New Times said they were like the ""Chipotle"" of Indian cuisine. When we arrived, we were greeted by a friendly server who apologetically explained that for now, they were going with a ""sit-down"" concept until they work some things out. 

The menu seemed quite small, but that could be a good thing right? That means they should be expertly crafted dishes. 

I asked for their choice of beverages. That got confusing because I didn't want the alcohol choices, just beverages other than water. I was told the list of soda options but I asked for ""other"" nonalcoholic beverages. Finally a connection was made. I chose a lime and ginger juice drink. When I received it, there was no detectable ginger in it. The server assured me that it contained ginger because he knew they had ginger in the kitchen. Then he came back to inform me that he tasted it and I was correct. There was no ginger. Then he said the manager tasted it and said, ""oh, there's supposed to be ginger in there?"" 

So, the food was ok. The chicken masala was my favorite. The chana dal was a little bland, and the saag chicken was ok. The bread was too oily. The rice was dry. And the rice pudding was kind of weird, but I liked the hint of rose water. I would have liked a creamier texture with rice that didn't seem like it was chopped up in the food processor first. And I don't know if a side of rice and a rice dessert was such a good idea. 

It was an awkward time of day to go there-right between when they close for two hours before dinner service. We were kind of locked in, followed by an apology from the manager that he was not locking us in, but rather locking others out. 

The non-ginger drinks were taken off our bill so for the price of our lunch $25, it was ok. I don't think I'd return for lunch, but I'd be willing to see what they can do for the dinner menu.

There is something for everyone here!

While that doesn't make me an expert in Indian food, it makes me someone who really enjoys it. After moving to the area, finding an Indian restaurant was a top priority. Marigold Maison caught my attention because of the terrific reviews and the fact that they had two of my favorite dishes on the menu - masala dosa and aloo gobi.

I've been after my wife to try the place since we got here and she finally agreed to so I made us a reservation for Saturday night. We were seated at a two-top next to the wall around the kitchen. Not horrible, but a bit disappointing given we had made a reservation. We ordered glasses of wine and the masala dosa. When I travel to India, the masala dosa is my standard everyday breakfast. I absolutely adore them and couldn't wait for my wife to try it. The dosa served was thick - almost like a tortilla instead of the paper-thin crispy dosa I'm used to. The filling was bland and the whole thing looked like it was flattened. The highlight was the coconut chutney, but the dosa itself was not very good. To top it off, my wife's wine was flat. Clearly the bottle had been open for a while.

After the appetizer, we waited for literally 15 minutes (I looked at my phone) waiting for the entrees. This was while we watched the people who came in after us get their entrees. When the food finally arrived, it was a total letdown. The Chicken vindaloo contained dry, chewy chicken and the vindaloo's only flavor component was ""spicy"". The saag panner was probably the only highlight of the entire experience, and it gained that position by being average in a meal of below average. The aloo gobi, one of my favorite dishes, was flavorless, lacked potato (you know, the aloo in aloo gobi) and had diced tomato in it, which was a first.

The final slap in the face was a check for over $90 for a very sub-par meal and disappointing service

Andy was a great host that kept our kids thoroughly entertained the entire evening. My kids now say let's go eat at ""Andy's Place"", not a name change suggestion just pointing out the impression he made. And as parents know entertaining the kids while out to eat can be a challenge. Lentil cakes and my standard chicken tikka masala were our choice that evening and they were as good as ever. I would recommend trying it out and will go again to see if they can edge up to 5 stars like the Bombay Spice of yore...

A side note, as I was leaving the restaurant, a couple mentioned to Andy how their ""dinner was good but they miss the buffet"". Andy pointed out that reviews for the buffet were not favorable on Yelp, at which point the couple proceeded to say Yelp reviews are a fraud, bla bla bla...I couldn't bare listening to it and felt like I needed to stand up for Yelp as someone that really finds value from it. It's no fraud!

He was screaming across the restaurant asking Stephanie (the waitress) if she even ""put the order in"" he said that he will make ""a scene"" (in this day and age that could be anything including some really scary stuff) and yelled at a baby that was crying. He was making the entire restaurant uncomfortable but neither Stephanie nor a manager made any attempts to make the restaurant feel safe and welcoming to the dozen or so other customers that were equally annoyed and/or scared. The fact that he was served showed to me that the manager does not care about the law whatsoever.

After he was given his food he gave a hug to Stephanie and  then squeezed her ass cheeks right in the middle of the restaurant. I was trying to have a nice relaxing dinner with my husband and not view a woman waitress get sexually harassed at her work place! Again, the manager was apathetic and did not put an end to it.

When my husband asked Stephanie ""was that guy for real?"" she seemed really confused as if screaming across a restaurant, yelling at a baby, being really intoxicated that you caused a scene and squeezing the ass cheeks of an employee is normal. Stephanie said that he was ""an old friend"" and didn't even apologize.

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"I would love for this place to be a go-to Indian place for me, but unfortunately I have to pass. I really, really love the idea and I love its intimate size, but it just seems to be a little too impressed with itself.

Firstly, the prices are too high. I know you're doing ""something new and funsion-y"" with Indian food, but please. $20 for a dish just because it has fish? It certainly doesn't warrant that, nor do the other dishes whose prices increase as you add meat selections like chicken, etc.

The last time I was here my husband and I ordered an eggplant dish and the chicken tikka masala.

I must say the chicken tikka sauce's flavor was OUTSTANDING. Definitely the best I've tasted - very robust and wonderful. 

The eggplant however, was terribly overpowered by chipotle. Yuck. I've not had those two paired together and I think there's a reason for that. Eggplant is so delicate and its flavor is best supported by the herbs and spices in the dish so its butteriness can be savored - not drowned out by an overly bold spice. Not a well constructed dish at all.

Also, both dishes were supposed to be mildly spiced. Our server asked for the spice level, we told her mild (husband doesn't do well with too much spice), and the food came out *at least* medium spiced or hotter. The eggplant was so spicy we had to send it back. My guess is that the chipotle had a lot to do with that, as its inherent heat certainly added to the additional spice used to give the spice gradient to the dishes. Again - chipotle - BAD IDEA.

The service that night also was not up to par and certainly didn't support the $46 bill we had at the end. The server *meandered* over to our table after we'd been sitting there for a little too long and kind of looked at us askance WAITING for us to tell her what we wanted. Like she couldn't be bothered too much to let more than just a few words out of her mouth. It was very strange. And the restaurant was NOT busy; no one was in the weeds.

All in all, I'm not really impressed enough to make this a regular place.

Now a bit more deeper into what a family of four  ordered here -

A Veg Platter  , Lamb Platter and Chicken Platter - it was a lunch special (so much for the special-ness )

Platter all combined -
The Bad :
1)The Platter had a standard Yellow Dal - which was Bland utterly Bland.
2)The Paneer was overcooked in the saag paneer,
3)The Chicken Masala was Sweet - soo much for the masala
4)The Cold Jeer Rice served with it
5) The Priceand the quantity - @14$ per platter you are better off having a sumptuous buffet at some decent Indian Restaurant and eating to your fill rather than being limited by their sub-par quality of food

The good :
1) The Lamb vindaloo was the only highlight
2) The Jamoon had a good texture and was well done

The Ugly :
SERVICE - the Server we had was possibly the worst we have encountered ever , we had to keep mentioning everything twice and keep reminding him we had an order we placed.
Here you are ""required"" to tip even if you had a bad service experience, well we did. 
Can you believe he had the audacity to come up and say he cant accept such a Low tip (which could have been better off had it been a ZERO) ?
Bravo !!

And yeah, they serve you Half a Naan in the platter - soo much for cost cutting!

My husband and I went here for our 15th wedding anniversary.  We always go to an Indian restaurant for our anniversary.  We usually have Indian food at an all-vegetarian Indian restaurant in Phoenix, but the food quality has become very inconsistent over the past year. So we searched online for a new restaurant and found Marigold Maison.  We were greeted immediately by (1) Mirnes Mehic, Director of Marketing, as soon as we walked in the door.  I know his name because he stopped by our table and chatted with us after our meal, talking about the restaurant, the chef, the food. He gave us his card.  We were in a corner table which was very cozy even though just about every table was filled.  The décor is lovely.  

Shortly after we were seated another (2) gentleman came over to let us know that our waitress would be with us soon but he could get our drinks.  Our (3) waitress soon arrived, was very friendly and took our order.  Before we really noticed that our food seemed to be taking a little longer than would be expected, our waitress came to tell us it would be out soon and placed a basket of complimentary papadums on the table.

We are vegetarians so we had: Dal Makhani, Saag Paneer, Masala Dosa, Garlic Naan, and Mango Lassi.   The food was excellent!!  Saag Paneer was some of the best we've had.  Masala Dosa was LOADED with potato, Dal Makhani was very flavorful, and the Garlic Naan was fantastic.  We had the leftover Dal and Saag the next day and it was even tastier.   A little warning, the hot sauce that's on the tables is not for the faint of heart. HOT, HOT but very flavorful and you can buy a bottle to take home.

During our meal a (4) gentleman came over the refill our drinks and take away any used dishes.  Another (5) lady came over later to remove any more dishes we were finished with.  Our waitress stopped by often to check on us.  Mirnes Mehic stopped by the table and spoke with us.  He stopped by again later to present us with a complementary Mango Kulfi for our anniversary!  As if we hadn't already received enough excellent service, (6) The Chef stopped by our table!

Shrimp had a very nice tandori oven cooked flavor to it, I enjoyed without any sauce as well as some of the sauce. My favorite was green one. They had four difference sauce, each was good.  Basmati rice was very good, I enjoyed it with red sauce. (I don't know what they are but tasty.  I asked for the name but I couldn't remember them).

For desert, I tried Rasmalai, Indian Cheesecake.  I never had Rasmalai before. In fact I never heard of the name before.  No pictures on the menu, I decided to try anyway as I like cheesecake.  Well, it was nothing like cheesecake I thought. I was actually quite taken back when I first saw it served. It ended up being quite good, very light, perfect way to end Indian meal. I thought it helped me settle my tummy. 

I didn't get to try any of their curry. I am looking forward to my next visit here and try their curry.",5,"[u' very good', u' really enjoyed', u' completely full', u' bold tea', u' still hot', u' hot tea', u' very nice', u' very good', u' quite good', u' very light', u' perfect way']",6.503333333,[],0

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"We were really excited for our date night at Marigold Maison as several friends raved about the restaurant and the food and we were celebrating a special occasion. Reading reviews we saw the space was small and made a reservation in advance for Friday evening. When we arrived the place was swamped and the servers seemed really overwhelmed. After waiting a few minutes a table was set for us and we were excited to check out the menu.

We ordered popadums for an appetizer and two curry dishes to share for the entree. The popadums arrived and our server said she would be right back with the sauces. The sauces never arrived. We snacked patiently on the bread while waiting for the sauces as we watched the servers rush between tables and patrons line up outside waiting. Both tables on either side of us were visibly annoyed as they were waiting for their checks. Finally they got the attention of what looked to be a front of house manager and he checked them out. It wasn't until our main dishes arrived that the server noticed the sauces never came - she said she asked someone else to get them for us, but he forgot.

At that point the appetizer was a bust as we were ready for the entrees - lamb saag and chicken curry. We liked the saag, but the chicken in the curry was dry. My husband was surprised there was only one Indian beer on the menu - as a restaurant that claims it is a ""fine indian experience"", it seemed less authentic.

All in all, I have to say our experience was just ""meh"". The food was okay but not great, we have had better from other places in the valley. The service fell short and the team knew it. I'm empathetic, as I was a server and can understand how exhausting and stressful it is when a place is busy like that - but unfortunately those feelings transfer to the patrons.

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"Absolutely incredible Indian food.  Definitely recommend the masala dosa, which is slightly cooler than most of the other spicy food and is good to have around to temper your mouth-fire.  We also had the samosa chaat, lamb vindaloo (FIRE!!!), chicken biryani hyderabadi, and chaat masala.  Make sure you order naan - you'll need it to sop up the awesome curry sauces and to put on your burning tongue like an ice-pack.  For dessert, we had the kala jamun and mango kulfi, both of which were icy in sensation and great after the burning meal.  Song of Fire and Ice, anyone?

They also serve cocktails, which will shore up your courage and make it so you're slightly less apprehensive about eating what you know is going to be authentic Indian spiciness.

I'm not even sure of the ingredients of half of what we ate, but it was all delicious, and we devoured it.  I recommend coming here with friends as you can order family-style and try even more dishes.

iE71iwcSljg3xm2GB2Y9aA,"Let me start by saying, I love Indian food.  I generally prefer lunch buffets because of all the variety.  However, I do know what I like so going out for Indian dinner is just fine, too.

My husband and our baby boy decided last minute to try out Marigold Maison. In terms of the food- it was ok.  The garlic naan was delicious. We had the paneer pakora for an appetizer- it was pretty good.  Most Indian restaurants that I have been to for dinner bring the condiments (tamarind, onion chutney, and mint chutney) on the side. The pakoras came with the sauces drizzled on the plate- an attempt to be fancy, I think. I prefer the sauces on the side because I like to eat them with the bread and my entree.

My entree, the vegetable korma, was ok- it was a little bland in comparison to other Indian restaurants.  My husband thought the lamb chops were really good.

We enjoy going out to eat and while great food is number one on the priority list for choosing restaurants, we also appreciate a nice ambiance, as well as excellent service.  I have been a waitress many times, so I tend to be more on the empathetic side of servers.  Tonight, I was digging deep and, really, the only thing I have nice to say is that the people working there seemed kind.  They were really terrible at time management and knowing how to take care of their tables, however.

We sat down on the patio and it took about 10-15 minutes to take our drink order. The table who sat down after us got their drinks, ordered an appetizer, and received their appetizer all before the 2nd waiter came to take care of us.  Waiter #1 was so flustered with what appeared to be a few tables, so he passed us on to Waiter #2.  We thought it was going to get better from there, but we were wrong.  It took our new waiter forever to bring us our check.  We never even got refills on water.  Bottom line- it's a small restaurant and we were forgotten about from the point of entry.

5P7zzVhWvO8nXGPdy7xqhw,"Allow me to set the scene...

Driving up to Lake Pleasant on a lovely Sunday morning; 5 excited friends chugging along on the 17.  The driver of our vehicle mentions his hunger and we all quickly agree that we too are hungry, because, you know, it's rare for people to be hungry at the same time, let alone on a Sunday morning.  He then goes on to suggest or demand (depending on hunger level) that he wants donuts. 

Being the tech savvy group that we are, we all bust out our phones like Quick Draw McGraw to search for the nearest donut place, hoping that we haven't passed something up already.  Opening up the Yelp app and furiously typing in ""donuts"" in the search box, the first result I get is Lamar's Donuts & Coffee.  I quickly clicked on the map and wouldn't you know it, we are barreling towards it at 65 miles an hour & we'd be needing to exit within the next minute.  Shouting out ""I found one! Exit on Bell!"" our dear driver exits and proceeds to turn onto Bell road.  

We are all so excited that we found a donut place that quickly and that close to us that we might as well have just skipped on into the building holding hands and whistling a light-hearted showbiz tune.  As soon as we set foot in this donut aroma-filled heaven, do our jaws do a figurative drop and the drooling commences.  Setting our eyes upon the rows of amazing looking donuts, we started randomly saying ""I want that!"" ""oooh, I want that one too."" etc.  

Kristi was there to greet us and asked how our morning was.  Without hesitation we all agreed that we wanted a dozen of these delectable donuts.  Kristi goes on to tell us about the Manager's special and which donuts apply to that.  One in our group asks for a clarification on the word ""donut"" as it pertains to the Manager's special.  Awesome Kristi, quickly said sarcastically ""The ones with the holes in the middle are donuts.""  We all had a laugh and ribbed the obviously stupid question, but all in good fun.  

Kristi offers us samples of donut holes and, my goodness...what amazing little treats those were. After we made our selections; a couple long johns, several butter reams, glazed etc., we then realized we needed beverages to help us wash down these dreamy donuts.  They have a great selection of coffee and lattes alike.  I noticed chai is on the board and, Kristi, being fantabulous, told us that she can make any Starbucks drink there and that she was quite the superstar.  Without a second thought I asked if she could make a iced chai and she said she could!  Within minutes she had dished out our drinks.

Now comes to the payment....

We all saddle up to the checkout and Kristi rings up our order and it came to about $27 total..  I only had a $10 on me and everyone in our group just awkwardly looked at each other, seemingly thinking ""I hope he/she pays this."" Two proceed to pull out cash and then, verrrry slowly, a third pulls out his wallet.  Lamar's sure knows how to hire them; Kristy picked on the third member of our group with a quip that he pulled out his wallet way too slow and that he did that on purpose so as not to have to help pay.

All of us gave one of those ,""ooooooooh!!! Dude she burned you!!"" and the like. She didn't let up either, the jokes kept coming from all angles and needless to say it gave us that extra kick in our step to continue to start the day off on the right foot.

We all said our tearful goodbyes to Lamar's and promised that we'd be back soon. Parting is such sweet sorrow.

Hopping in the car to start our journey to Lake Pleasant again, the donuts immediately filled the entire car with their scent and again, our drooling began. It was like reliving the first time we walked into Lamar's, that happened a whopping 15 minutes ago; but it felt like a lifetime instead. Whipping open the box, we were all given our donuts of choice and then silence fell upon the car.  No one spoke a word, but instead we let out occasional ""mmmmm""'s as we all enjoyed and savored these fabulous treats.  

So rich, so creamy, so perfect.

Thank you Lamar's and Yelp for bringing us to this temple for donuts.  If you haven't gone before, you must go immediately!!! Kristi was fabulous and I wish more people were like her; it made our morning that much more enjoyable and we will definitely be back! You rock!

There's not much more to say - every flavor they make is delicious - I don't even know if I could pick a favorite.  They are all absolutely delicious (They are not overly sweet like Krispy Kreme ).  I prefer them greatly over Krispy Kreme and of course any grocery store donuts. 

Let me tell you why we recently stopped here to get some donuts. I was watching a TV called ""Shark Tank"" .  Shark Tank is an American reality TV series. The show features a panel of ""potential investors"", called ""sharks"", who consider offers from ""aspiring entrepreneurs"" seeking investments for their business or product. The entrepreneur or ""contestant"" can make a deal on the show if a panel member is interested. 

I saw a a compay on the show called Tom+Chee. They serve all kinds of grilled cheese sandwiches and old fashioned tomato soup. Anyway the featured a Grilled Cheese Donut ( a glazed donut cooked kije tou would any other grilled cheese sandwich. I was intrigued  by this thus the need to visit Lamar's Donut Shop. Plus I needed a large sized donut and Lamar's are bigger than most other donuts. By the way the donut grilled cheese sandwich we made was a little to sweet for my liking but everyone else who tried it, loved it.

How bonkers? So bonkers that the line inside weaves around long enough that I can't spot a six-foot-four husband. I go back outside and text, ""why don't I see you?""  Sure enough, he's over in line perfectly behind where people are paying, just enough in a blind spot. Are we all this sugar-starved and crazy? One free donut and we line up single-file like teacher's got the whip. And, some people, so lazy! Won't even get out of the car - they go through the drive thru. Losers!

The best part of the fifty-deep line inside was the look on someone's face as they entered. Then, the current last-in-line slowly raised up a white placard like they were bidding at auction. Eye contact was made. The card read, ""END"".  Then you saw the dope at the door get a ""WOW!"" again face and the torch was passed. Olympic event here, this donut line! 

Was it worth it? 

The line moved fast and we had fun. It was gorgeous weather in Phoenix - cool(ish) and breezy - very entertaining watching the blondest-haired little boy outside trying to keep hold of his napkin while double fisting a chocolate donut and getting most of it smeared all over his face. It didn't hurt that the hilarious lady behind us was narrating it in a Southern dialect, ""I got responsibilities, see, I got to keep hold of the napkin but no way I'm putting down this donut."" And his little elbow kept trying to track the napkin. 

I'm certain that kid don't care that Lamar's is a franchise - Ray Lamar had one shop since 1960, in Kansas City, Missouri until he decided to franchise in 1990. This is the only Lamar's in Arizona. (Your next closest is Denver.) on a normal day, the shop is spacious, very clean and offers ample seating. I can't say enough great, I mean, terrible, terrible things about the staff here. And the variety of donuts...

Surprisingly, I dislike all these donuts equally! The fresh raspberry bursting from the glazed and filled, the lousy cake donuts, and the longest John that I'm sure is being measured by Guinness Book as we speak. (They don't call 'em ""long johns"" here, they're ""Lamar bars"" btw.) and the price - I forget if it's .98 or .89 (donut-induced-dyslexia) but the price is a steal. (Specialty one & fritters are a little more.)

I'm sure the next time we're here - when there are only ten people in line - and no ""END"" card - we'll miss this one crazy donut day.

I have lost count now of how many times I show up 1, 2, 3 hours before closing and they are picked clean. That, in and of itself, I can forgive. But showing up and finding the chairs already up on the tables and the floors being cleaned more than an hour before closing? Talk about spitting in your customer's face. I used to ask myself, why even let people in the door if you're not interested in selling anything past noon-ish? 

Got my answer today. Showed up at 1:15pm, found the door locked, chairs up on the tables, signage turned off. Employee was cleaning the drive-thru intercom/display and another guy walked by the windows inside, so obviously the employees were there. I guess they figured they were low enough on donuts that they didn't want to work a full shift or something.

I'm sorry but if I drive halfway across town thinking I for once have a chance to reach the store before it closes, and then over 45 minutes before closing, you lock the doors and give me the finger? Sorry, but there's no way you're getting anything but a 1-star review after that. You're only open until 2pm and you can't even make that work? Come on. 

Will I go back? Yeah, maybe if I'm in the neighborhood when they open, but apparently they don't stock enough product, don't stay open for the full published operating ours and don't even have the decency to at least sell drinks and their other merchandise until the actual closing time.

LaMar's Donuts makes donuts like what I grew up eating!

Sometime in the early 1980s, something changed in the donut world, and not for the better.  The donuts just weren't as tasty as they had been.  I remember my best friend and I discussing this on several occasions back then.  

Over the years, I started to attribute this to 'growing up' and 'tastes change' (like how when I tried to eat kid's breakfast cereal (Captain Crunch with Crunchberries) after I moved out, it was really disappointing).

Yesterday, we finally went to LaMar's and it shattered that theory.  From the moment I saw the display case, it felt like the donut shops of my youth...they just..looked right...

We ordered an assortment of classics and took our box home.

From the first bite, my donut world was rebooted.  Om'goodness.  Fabulous!

The Bavarian Cream donut had proper cream filling (not the gritty crap Dunkin foists on you).  The donut was light and soft and perfect. Mmmmmmmm.

The cinnamon roll was huge!!!  And - wiping a tear away - perfect.  

It's waaaayyyy across town for an early morning drive, but..I WILL be back!!!

As a child growing up in Orange County, Ca., we had not only Winchells donuts but Mom and  Pop joints that  were usually ran by a sweet Asian family who knew how to make a great donut. You'd find them on almost every corner. From my earliest donut memories of stopping for donuts on the way to church or mom buying donuts for birthday party  , or later when donuts provided me comfort during my parents divorce to the fun of buying a dozen donuts on the way home from a wild college night , donuts have  been there for me , like my own sacred rite of passage thru my life. 
Okay that might be stretching it a bit.. but donuts are chocked with memories for me .  So the anticipation was high as I decided on my sick day to stop for a comforting donut or two at Lamars. When I walked in I hoped that somehow a little ole lady would come out from behind the counter but no instead I ordered from the local chain  . 
The first donut was an old fashioned , it tasted like it was right off of  memory lane , sweet but not sickening, great dough , lightly iced. I was taken back to every yummy donut I ever adored... Great!  I made my second  donut an old favorite , pink iced cake donut ..here is where it all went horribly wrong .. the donut tasted dry ,over cooked,with a gaggy sweet non distinguishable icing...the horror...

We picked our pizzas, one thin crust and one stuffed, as well as picked up a cinnamon wheel for dessert. I can agree with other posts that, although interesting, it seems odd to pay for a pizza that I had to pick up and then bake at home when I could have had a pizza (or two even!) delivered to my door for the price of one. The nice part is the freshly made pizza and toppings assembled right in front of you as well as the very courteous service in the shop. The pizza itself was decent and tasted good but we felt that it wasn't really anything special. It's a good place to go if you happen to be nearby and want to pick up a pizza for later....not when you're already hungry, of course. And so you don't feel like you should have just ordered delivery from one of the major pizza chains for the same price, make sure to use a coupon to get the best deal!",3,"[u' interesting concept', u' nice part', u' very courteous', u' good place']",2.58,[],0

Stick the oven on at 425F. Go and visit a clean place, chat with the magic makers behind the counter while they prepare your order. They'll even hold the door open for you when you leave, which is a really nice touch in my opinion.

Lovely fresh ingredients every time, try the Veggie Deluxe and you'll see what I mean. Papa's Favourite is always high on the list and if you order the stuffed option prepare to be full after one slice.

The comments from people that think waiting 12-15 minutes when you get home to have a perfectly cooked pizza, is beyond my comprehension of the word lazy. After all you afforded the time to go there in the first place.

A little tip to the people that can afford the time and wait for a delicious pizza. Take it off the provided tray 2 minutes before it's ready and put it back in for the perfect base. But use oven gloves please and be careful as it'll be proper hot.

All in all a spot on place. I'm sorry about not giving it five stars. It is only pizza after all.

I had a meatball and pepperoni calzone which was good, but had less cheese (especially ricotta) than I expected and had the doughiest crust I've ever had in a calzone. Really needs more of a crispy crust to give it the right texture.

My girlfriend had the meatball and pepperoni pizza which she said was OK, but didn't seem to have the right kind of cheese on it. It appeared to have both mozzerella and ricotta. She's not a big fan of ricotta, so it was a bit of a turn off for her.

Finally we went and grabbed some takeout one night.  I ordered what I figured would be their specialty, you know spaghetti with meatballzzzzzzz.  It came with a few garlic knots as well.  I ate the garlic knots in the car, and they were actually really good.  Well, some of them were.  The ones that for some reason or another were missing the garlic were just blah.

Everyone at work has been talking about these amazing balls. I've been waiting to try it out too but the lunch traffic around this area is a total turn off. Bring a gun with you so you can shoot all the idiots in the parking lot.

The place was busy and the menu was pretty much a translation of 101 ways to eat a meatball. Meatball and spaghetti, meatball and penne, meatball and meatball... you get the drift.

I decided to try a classic: the spaghetti and meatball. If you screw this up, I ain't comin' back! Well they didn't! I got my spaghetti quick, even before I had a chance to fill my drink cup. I like that the spaghetti is served in a ceramic bowl and it comes two delicious butter rolls. These were the best part.

That said, I stopped in to Meatballz today for lunch.  Meatballz catered a meeting at the office a few months back and I remember liking what I tried (cheese ravioli, I believe).

The lunch rush was over when we arrived and we were able to walk right up to the counter to order.

We paid, filled our drinks, and sat down.

The small shop was very clean and pretty comfortable.  The music playing over the loudspeakers wasn't too loud or too soft.  Yay for that!  We waited just a few minutes before our meals were brought out.  My friend ordered the eggplant parm sub and I ordered the penne with two meatballs.  Both portions were huge and piping hot.  I was pleased with the flavor of the sauce and the meatballs.  The pasta was a bit mushier than I enjoy and definitely nowhere close to al dente.  Also included were two small rolls - ""garlic knots"" I believe.  They were not very good at all; the texture was off and there wasn't much flavor, garlic or otherwise.

There were cheese tortellini's, marinated mushrooms and peppers, artichoke hearts, mozzarella chunks, ham-provolone-salami twists, olives, tomatoes, red onion- omg I'm getting dizzy-----It was incredible! I chose the balsamic dressing (which was marvelous!) but there were several other kinds to choose from. The only thing that I could think of to add to this salad would be boiled egg slices.

For un-salad-y people, they have pasta, sandwiches, calzones and sasuage wraps as well. Those will go over well when I bring my sweetie to Meatballz.

I had half a Meatball Hero.  I asked the (very friendly) gal behind the register if I should get a whole or a half sandwich.  She said, ""depends on how hungry you are.""  I say, get a whole.  Don't bother with the half.  You don't even have to worry about looking like a pig if you get a whole.  Forget about the half, unless you're a child.

The half was small.  It was 5 inches long and not the stuffed full sandwich I was expecting.  What I did have was OK, though.  The roll was outstanding.  The sauce and meatball were acceptable.

I went with two friends.  One got an Eggplant Parm Hero half and the other, Manicotti.  The Eggplant Parm was the same as the Meatball.  It was good but small, again.  My friend who ordered the Manicotti liked it but I didn't taste any myself.

In the end, I left hungry and $7.00 poorer.  For the extra $2 to make my half a whole, my experience would have been a lot better, I think.  Either way though, I don't think I'll be returning to Meatballz.  I'd give it 2 1/2 stars if I could.",3,[u' full sandwich'],0.35,[],0

Drinks where great. I just got a simple Captain Morgan & Diet coke, double, and it was great.  Drink came out very quickly.
Food was also amazing for airport food. I had the mac & cheese with ham, and it was really good. Not super gourmet and definitely not the best, but I was craving something along those lines so it hit the spot. It also came out really fast, so bonus for that.
Service was really friendly and very fast.

Only downside is that the tables are really close, so I was sitting really close to someone I didn't even know (might as well of been at the same table). Kinda weird, but both of us seemed to have other business to attend to (I was focused on my laptop most of the time.)

Overall, this was great. It was really close to my gate, good food, good drinks. $22 for a meal at the airport where I can sit down and have a drink is usual, so I am not going to complain about the price at all.

One review here said Terminal A, so I figured they probably meant The A Concourse at Terminal Four. Low and behold, after clearing security and doing my usual striptease for TSA,  there it was at The A Concourse near Gate A7.
There was actually a wait (albeit a short one) to be seated. The low-lighting scheme works well. Faux crystal chandeliers hang about the bar. There is also a communal table and tables and chairs. The tables that flank the entrance and are open to the concourse have cool leather sofas. AND they play really good music. The menu is limited:burgers, sandwiches and salads pretty much. They have some good appetizers though and some good beers on tap (I like the 20 ounce option they offer)
This is probably the best time I've had in a long time waiting for a flight (except at London Heathrow at the Virgin Atlantic Clubhouse......that flight could have been delayed seven hours and I would have been a happy camper)

There are two types of airport eating: 1) Looking for something that's a good value and quickly; and 2) Looking for a good meal, and not caring if you have to pay $20 to get it. 

This place is only for those in the #2 camp. We had a 3 hour layover in Phoenix getting home from vacation. We just wanted good food and beers, and did not care about airport mark up, as long as we could get something good. $10 burger, $12 pork sliders, and a couple of 20 oz draft beers for $7 each. It's the airport - what are you gonna do? You can eat at the fast food steak sandwich place with screaming kids and crappy service up the way for a few bucks less... by why bother?

Food was really good. Exceptional for the airport. The fries were very hot, fresh, and plentiful. The burger was very good. The pork sliders were excellent.

After placing my order and paying, I watched an employee make my smoothie.  As my drink was blending, she reached for an empty cup in preparation for the transfer but she missed and knocked it onto the ground.  Instead of throwing that cup away and getting a new one, she bent down, picked the cup off the ground, proceeded to transfer my smoothie from the blender INTO THE DIRTY CUP, then handed it to me like there wasn't anything wrong.

I called her on it, and she proceeded to make me a new smoothie, albeit reluctantly, because she was clearly agitated that I asked for a replacement.

It's too bad really, because I couldn't enjoy my smoothie without freaking out just a little bit with every sip.

I made reservations through Yelp for dinner here during the week - super easy process that went off without a hitch BTW - and we were happy to see that they were ready for us to be seated right away upon arrival. My 2 out of town coworkers had no issues finding the place, despite the restaurant being in the back, but I missed the turn and ended up circling around. Plenty of parking out back though and such a wonderful rustic hip vibe inside. Loved it from the moment I walked in. 

Our waiter was amazing - seemed genuinely excited about his job and getting to share this awesome food with us. I ordered a Okra Cup and an Old Fashioned - both under 10 bucks each for HH. The Chicken Skins and Dilly Beans were also on HH and amazing. I'm in love with picked anything and those Dilly Beans were the perfect bite to compliment a very rich fried skin and hot honey plate. 

For our meals, my coworkers went for the Fried Chicken and Mash Potatoes and I did the Short Rib dish. I can't imagine a more melt-in-your-mouth bite than the Short Ribs. So good. Judging by the clean plates across the table from me, the chicken definitely hit the spot as well. Next time, I'll have to try the Pie, from Pie Snob but we went dessertless and just finished up our drinks to close out an awesome meal.

Only downside about this place was that the server was not very familiar with the menu.

I don't have a refined pallet therefore don't want to go into each dish except to say they were freaking delicious! The chicken skins were amazing (covered in Honey....I know, so good), and the dessert donut was UNREAL. So,so good!!

So far, 
I've had the chicken skins..  Honestly absolutely delightfully tasty... The crispy skin and the sweet and spicy drizzled honey sauce pairs well with their Okra Hot sauce.  (just be careful pouring the sauce out of that bottle... it has a wide mouth and you'll have a plate full of sauce)

I also ordered the Tennessee style fried chicken.  A leg and a thigh.  I was not quite a impressed with this as I was the chicken skins.  The chicken wasn't seasoned well enough and to me, Tennessee hot style chicken (like Gus') is not wet, its actually dry.  Nevertheless, the chicken was still very tasty and I would have it again, but request the sauce on the side.

To start, if you are going to launch with a series of complex cocktails then you better be prepared to have enough bartenders to handle the business.

Please, just give us a minute or two when we ask to give us a minute or two.  Then, there is the food.  The food is fine and presented well.  But that's just it - it was fine.

I had called ahead to make a reservation for 7:30 and they mentioned that they don't take reservations for that time, however we could make it for 8 o'clock instead. No issue there. The hostess asked if we were celebrating anything and I mentioned my friend's engagement and that we were going to bring a cake for her to enjoy. I also mentioned that we would be having mostly drinks and maybe some appetizers so that they didn't expect us to be enjoying a full coursed meal. 
Arriving, our server Matthew seemed very unenthused to be helping us right away. Everyone enjoyed multiple cocktails and most ordered some sort of food. When I asked Matthew if we could have some small plates to split the cake, he mentioned that unless I called ahead and told them about the cake, we couldn't enjoy it inside the facilities. We did call ahead...
Anyway, he ""talked to the manager"" and reported back that we couldn't do it. That's fine. So, I asked for some to-go silver wear so that we could enjoy the cake in the parking lot. Matthew's response: ""we don't have those""
My thought: ""you never have to-go orders??""
My friend kindly asked another server for some utensils and he easily retrieved them for us. 

My point is: I'm not sure how or why we pissed off our server, but I've worked in the service industry for many years and I made sure to make it aware to everyone that we were there to enjoy cocktails and the company of our friends for the bachelorette.

I made a reservation on OpenTable a few days before NYE; the restaurant called me the day before to confirm which was nice. When we arrived, we were seated at the table right next to the entrance. The restaurant isn't too big with only a few standard tables, some high tops, & bar seating. I wasn't a fan of our proximity to the door so I asked if we could be moved to a high top. They were happy to accommodate the table change which we appreciated.

Our server came by and got our drink orders of the Hurricane & the Blueberry Buck. We also started off with an order of the Mac & Cheese balls with marinara sauce. Both drinks were really tasty, strong and full of flavor as noted in the descriptions. The Mac & Cheese balls were nothing special, but a decent-sized appetizer to ramp up our appetite for dinner.

I can't think of the last time my fiancé & I ordered the same thing at a restaurant, but we were both so enticed by the Tennessee Hot fried chicken that we both got that for our main course. I added a side of cornbread & my fiancé added a side of black eyed peas & a biscuit. The black eyed peas & biscuit were both okay options for sides, I personally liked the black eyed peas more. To my surprise, the fried chicken was already served with cornbread so I had two pieces of dry cornbread. They were slightly burnt around the edges & just tasted off. I love cornbread, so that was highly disappointing. Moreover though, what I wasn't expecting was the amount of hot sauce! The fried chicken was almost at room temperature & then drenched in hot sauce which caused it to be super soggy .. completely unappetizing that I only had a couple of bites & was done.

We came early to try a bunch of things from the HH menu menu.  Chicken skins, hush puppies, corn bread, hoe cakes, cheese balls, etc...  Definitely not health food, but my soul felt much better at the end of the night.

Regarding spice, they have concocted an interesting balance between sweet and spicy.  Plus, their hot sauce on the tables has a wide mouth, so be careful that you don't get more than expected.

I'm going to fore warn I'm going to make a few comments but it was still good and I would go back again.

Tried the fried chicken skins and bone marrow/biscuit/short rib - pepper jelly for the appetizer.  Biscuit was extremely dense AKA rock hard, to me it robbed the marrow snd jelly of the glory of being a fantastic dish. I know it is unconventional but I wouldn't have minded the marrow and short rib - pepper jelly on a KFC biscuit instead.  My mouth was focused on the brick underneath the savory goodness. As for the chicken skins...less is more sometimes. The batter on the skins was so thick it was ballooned around the skin....a lightly dusting on the skins would have highlighted a good old fashioned treat kicked up a notch with a spicy honey.

The pot pie with mash was good. It was exactly what it said it was...no frills. No peas. Herbs, spices, cheese and garlic are to cliche for the hipster vibe with mash potato but we all know how good it is...too bad they were absent.

Southern hot fried chicken was done well with good flavor, heat and seasoning. It came with a brick of cornbread.  Literally brick.

AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw,"While I so wanted to love Okra, I unfortunately did not. Let me start on a positive note - I love the decor, the waitress was a total sweetheart and the fried chicken skins were excellent. However, we had some problems with our cocktail, which were never remedied. My husband, a regular vodka drinker, ordered a vodka/soda. When it arrived he took a sip because it tasted funny and asked me to taste it. I tasted it and sure enough noticed exactly what he was talking about - it tasted like tequila mixed with vodka. We informed the waitress and requested a fresh drink and she said others had complained of the same problem, but that she thinks it's just ""the type of vodka they use."" (The bar uses Titto's vodka, which my husband has had many times.) The waitress replaced the cocktail anyway and brought a fresh one, but when we tasted that one, it again tasted like tequila. My husband (who used to work in a bar) notified the waitress that the bar tender was likely not rinsing the measurer between measuring different liquors and she assured my husband that he does. Since were were sitting near the bar we were able to watch the bar tender make drinks and saw firsthand that he was definitely not rinsing the measuring cup between liquors and confirmed this was the cause of the tequila vodka soda. Since tequila has such a powerful flavor, it was finding its way into our vodka soda every time. We paid for the drink, but my husband could barely drink it. Now, onto the food - we ordered a seafood special which they offered for the evening. It consisted of five shrimp, some mussles and two oysters, along with a piece of bread and some pickled green beans. The cooks forgot to include my oysters along with my meal and they also left an item of another gentleman's dinner at my table. But the worst part of it was that the mussels were slimy and undercooked. I didn't send it back and just kind of stomached what I could and put aside much of it, because we had already complained about the drink and I didn't want to be ""that customer.""

Thanks to GM Dan S. and sous chef Curtis for introducing themselves and for showing courtesy, patience, and understanding, as well as to bartender Brennan, who was very pleasant to converse with and was empathetic, as he too grappled with a few food issues of his own.  Also, I needed a bandage after losing the one I had on after washing my hands, so I asked Brennan if there was one that the kitchen could spare.  He kindly went back to look for some, and came back to let me know that someone had used the very last one that afternoon, but that he'd go ""next door to ask for a couple.""  What great customer service!

[1] Had emailed for allergen info earlier this afternoon and received a reply from GM Dan Scheuring in less than an hour.  (I'm impressed!  Most restaurants take at least a day, or two, and some don't respond at all.  Kudos to OKRA's staff!!)  I had planned on taking advantage of another restaurant's late brunch hours, but because Dan had taken the time to consult with Sous Chef Alex Curtis regarding menu items that included specific allergens I'd asked about AND attached a list of items from all three food menus (snacks, shares, and bigs) ""that would be friendly"" to me, I decided to drive out to OKRA on this very hot day (high of 118!) and see what culinary delights I would find.  

[2] The menus kindly state no substitutions and only omissions will be granted, so I'm very grateful that Dan and sous chef Curtis worked with me to make my first visit positively memorable.  

p.s.  OKRA was a little tricky to find, since the signage on 7th St. was small (the letters for OKRA do not take a lot of space), and another signage said ""around the back.""

Other diners were not wowed by the fried chicken or catfish either. I was shocked when I received the bill and it was 13.00 for 1 glass of wine.  That being said, that Chardonnay was fantastic.  At that price I would never order a 2 nd glass. For 2 people with 1 entree, 1 salad, and 1 glass of wine it was 48.00., without tip. Another issue was it was freezing in the dining area, and every time the door opened we got another blast of cold breeze. I don't get why they label this restaurant Italian.  My rib had alfredo sauce on it, but that's all we got out of that. They also advertise fish fry where there was none,and were also told there prices went up, so the menu was incorrect.

For starters we had the delicious chicken skins that had a nice kick with sweetness, cornbread that tasted like waffles (so good), and hush puppies. Then I decided to try a Mint Julep! It had a big sprig of mint and was beautiful covered with snow--well powered sugar that looked like snow. The drink looked like a snow cone made with round pellets of ice. Don't let the smooth taste fool ya! This drink packs a punch. Helped me sleep all night. We went on to order Buttermilk Meatball with Grits (creamiest grits I every eat), Catfish Gremolata with Okra Succotash, and Sal Focaccia, all very delicious. Can't wait to visit Okra again.

Hopefully they will work out the kinks in their menu and we'll consider giving it another try.",3,"[u' so excited', u' happy hour', u' really friendly']",1.55,[],0
AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw,"I was there for the soft opening Friday night and it was packed.  Before I start let me say that I love Crudo and I want to love Chef Cullen's newest venture just as much.  Southern food generally speaking is simple food for simple palates, this is not a criticism, just an observation.  Southern food is comfort food and usually comes in heaping servings, it comes with grits, collared greens, big biscuits, mac and cheese, fried green tomatoes, red beans and rice and fried potatoes of some sort.  It comes out big, glistening and hot.  This is not exactly what you will get at Okra.

I started with the fried chicken skins for my first appetizer and it was as delicious it sounds.  It was not a big serving but it was enough.  The honey drizzled on top was a nice touch.  My other appetizer was the okra, the namesake for Crudo #2 and I expected something special.  It was perhaps the most tender non woody okra I have ever chewed on and I appreciate that, but it was also lacking in flavor.  Maybe it was boiled too long, or left on the grill too long or the combination of boiling and grilling, I don't know.

I ordered the fried chicken and it was very good, fried to the point where it was more brown than golden. I do not know if the chicken was organic but I expect it was because the breast and leg were not huge and plump like the kind you might pull out of a red and white bucket.  I keep going back to size and portions not because I am a gourmand, but because of the incongruity with the theme.  I would have enjoyed a side of grits, collared greens and a biscuit to go with those two smaller than expected pieces of chicken.  Lastly I ordered the Johnnycakes because I was craving something starchy.  The johnnycakes were a bit of a disappointment, essentially small pancakes without butter or syrup or powdered sugar or fruit or jam,  but instead it came with something I recognized from my years in Richmond, pimento cheese.  I used to eat this on crackers mostly at parties, but it just seemed odd sitting there cool and stiff next to the johnnycakes which were not nearly hot enough to make the cheese melt.    

Lastly, I have to give very high marks to the bar.  The drinks were exceptional and this was no surprise.  I noticed that one of the cocktails the ""Folk and Americana"" incorporated Old Overholt rye whiskey and I have to give props to whoever made the decision to use this much maligned (and unfairly so) working man's rye to make such a wonderful cocktail.  The Greenpoint too hit the mark, a higher octane version of the Manhattan (rye in place of whisky and Chartreuse substituted for Vermouth) yet smooth and aromatic as could be.

I would like to see a dimmer room and some traditional comfort sides and this would be a real winner.",3,"[u' nice touch', u' very good', u' more brown', u' there cool', u' nearly hot', u' very high', u' wonderful cocktail']",3.818,"[u' fried chicken', u' not huge', u' essentially small']",-1.05

The waitress was nice enough to let me order two drinks at happy hour pricing and told the bartender not to make the 2nd drink until I was ready. The drinks were good and strong and probably saved the meal because the food was not memorable.  We ordered wings for the table which would have been good if they had some salt. We all ordered burgers which again, could have been better if there was salt on them.

The space was a little hard to find as it is in the back of a building that faces 7th (awe parked out front where there were some businesses still being built, but there is a huge lot in back). The restaurant is decorated nicely and has a 'cool' modern feel.  I went with a friend for happy hour and we went a little crazy with ordering. They have so many drinks on special, it was easy to find something that sounded delicious. I tried the okra cup and the cobbler... both were incredibly tasty and strong! I definitely felt them afterwards. We shared some food - the marinara focaccia, wings, Calabrian pork bites, and the biscuit donut. The pork bites came out first and were just ridiculously delish... little pieces of pork belly with a bit of a tang and a hint of spiciness... the portion was small, but the flavor was huge. The huge pile of wings were also wonderful.... they are smoked, which was a bit weird at first, but as we ate them we liked them more and more. The wings came with a 'white' bbq sauce.... I don't know what this was, but it was like crack.... so tasty. In fact, the white sauce and the hot sauce on the table really saved the focaccia, which was nothing special ( but tasted good when you added the sauces). The donut was tasty, but didn't taste much like biscuit... still good though. I will definitely be back, I want to try the Tennessee hot chicken... yum.

Okra is a family friend of Crudos apparently -- wink!

I came here with a friend and at first we were both kind of lost since there was still construction going on.  However, once we found the entrance we were relieve to find a cute comforting restaurant!

We sat at the high top tables next to the bar since we wanted a view.  We started off with some cocktails since you can't turn down an award winning mixologist in the house!  I went for the Spirit Animal; tequila, sherry, lime, apple and pear bitters.  Overall, a solid drink to wet my palates for what's to come.  My partner ordered the Pina Tail on the Donkey; Appleton rum, Bacardi, smith & cross rum, mint and pineapple syrup.  Needless to say, it was a strong drink, beautifully poured, fun to look at, and fun to drink!

For our food we shot for the Hush Puppies to start and for the entree we ordered the Smoked Pork Osso Bucco and Catfish.  We both totally dig the hush puppies; soft within and crunchy cover while the goat cheese gave it a hint of creamy sweetness.  The pickled salad provided a sour punch.  My smoked pork came in an impressive style presentation; pretty much felt like I was going to eat a brontosaurus leg (yab-da-ba do!).  The meat was super tender and fell off the bone while the greens and black eye peas below which provided some extra flavors of sourness to the subtle meaty entree.  My partner's catfish dish was baked and came on a bed of okra succotashed gremolata.  She said it was good but was lacking in spice and flavors.  Overall, we love the originally of the food, but the lack flavors in certain aspects.

Our server Michelle was amazing! Not only did she know the menu in and out but she really had a passion for what was on there! It's always refreshing to see a servers eyes light up when describing a dish, and actually be invested in what she was talking about! I highly recommend asking for Michelle, you will not be disappointed!

Now to the food! These will not be big giant feed your face plates, you are going to get a serving of some real passion and love of flavors, a southern background mixed with some Italian flair. It may sound daunting but please please try it and see for yourself how great a combination these two can be! 

Stacked salad to start, of course not a tradition Caesar but the flavors are robust and delicious and the corn bread croutons will make you never look at a normal crouton the same!  

Verde focaccia to share, excellent use of goat cheese, you get a good flavor but not over powering mixed with the pesto was on point! Crust was cooked perfectly nice and crispy but wasn't over done. 

Pimento burger to my self! I have to say I've had this burger numerous times I can't seem to get enough of this. Excellent flavors; the homeboys comeback sauce, the pickles, pimento cheese all mixed in to each delicious bite after bite. I would definitely recommend this to be one of the best burgers in the valley and would put it up against any others you might hold near and dear to your heart.

AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw,"I am a huge fan of Crudo, so when I heard about Okra I knew I had to try it! So when I popped online and checked out their menu and saw Fried Chicken Skins with Honey Hot Sauce, I knew this was going to be a dangerous love affair. I mean seriously lets all be honest here... The best part of the fried chicken is that delicious crunchy exterior that has been deep fried to golden perfection! I mean if it wasn't, why would we order fried chicken and not just eat a boring chicken breast.... anyways getting off point here.

The restaurant itself is nice and modern, we sat on the patio since it was a beautiful spring night. Service was amazing (make sure you ask for Michelle!), cocktails were killer (old fashioned was on point but the real winner was the sazerac)

Being the fatties we are we ordered a plethora of food - because why not try it all! Obviously we ordered the fried chicken skins with the hot honey sauce, which is a must. The oysters al griglia were a serious home run! The conspicuous amounts of butter and garlic in those tiny bad boys was what oyster dreams are made of. Those oysters can know that they died for a noble cause. The smoked chicken wings were good not great, and the bone marrow with biscuits and ox tail and pepper jam at what dreams are made of. 

Their smoked ham hock is the the true stand out of the evening... braised, smokey, tender, are all words i can use to describe this dish. No need for a knife here - its literally a fall off the bone delectable treat, 

And after all of this, we still ate dessert! Donuts. I ended my meal with a donut covered in more salted caramel than should be legal! Not that I am complaining. Next time I want to take that donut and cover it with a piece of their chicken skin.

So if your looking for killer food, great drinks and a fun atmosphere where you can take your taste buds on a wild food ride than should be street legal, Okra is your spot!",5,"[u' huge fan', u' delicious crunchy', u' golden perfection', u' beautiful spring', u' hot honey', u' noble cause', u' true stand', u' more salted', u' great drinks']",5.05,"[u' fried chicken', u' boring chicken', u' fried chicken', u' serious home', u' bad boys', u' smoked chicken', u' not great']",-4.033333333

It was our first time here and we wanted to see what all the hype was about. We started our meal with the smoked wings. Yep, they are just as good as they sound. Cooked very well, great portion and the sauce on them is killer. No need to dress them up anymore.

For our meals, I ordered the buttermilk meatballs and grits. I'll be honest, the main star of this dish were the grits and marinara sauce. The meatballs were fine, nothing I hadn't had before. The grits on the other hand, were savory and delicious. The marinara on the meatballs also went well with the dish and seemed very fresh.

The wife ordered the fried chicken and that didn't disappoint. It was very good and worth ordering. The corn bread that came with her dish is some of the best corn bread I have ever had.

A resident of Phoenix when Crudo opened its doors to almost universal fanfare from local writers and ""foodies"" alike I have to admit I was not initially a fan of Cullen Campbell's minimalistic cooking or stripped-down space, but told that Okra sees the Chef returning to his Southern roots while continuing to dish Italian intrigue got the best of me, the food almost across-the-board successful while the setting trends hip without 'trying too hard.'

Again occupying a backdoor lot, the patio a lovely place to dine during happy hour as the sun slowly sets, it was just moments after four that I entered Okra's main door and greeted by a hostess with my choice of tables the al fresco option proved pertinent mainly due to the decibel level within, bands like The Black Keys piped overhead alongside others more rooted in Blues.

Reportedly a place that starts hopping after seven, the cocktails no doubt a focus with classics and seasonal specialties crafted by one of the best barmen in town, it was at the advice of a waiter who seemed somewhat green that the newly launched PTO was selected, the smallish pour a bit steep at $12 even for someone hailing from Las Vegas though the fruit-forward complexity was no doubt well conceived.

Undoubtedly more knowledgeable than both my server and the average client about the majority of ingredients on the menu, Happy Hour prices slicing $2-$8 dollars off of several options and thus allowing for ten different plates plus the beverage at a total cost of just $84 before tax and tip, it was with a two-by-two progression that the tasting took place, a pyramid of dates stuffed with spicy Calabrian sausage absolutely heavenly while the fried chicken skins were as rich as would be expected, spicy desert honey keeping umami in check.

Taking a break from the spice to enjoy fluffy hushpuppies beneath a light salad smeared with goat cheese alongside a buttermilk biscuit that was unfortunately so dry that even with added honey it was unpleasant to eat, improvement was quickly found in a lightly charred flatbread piled with thick-cut  Calabrese and its table-mate hoe cakes with rich ham from Benton's and housemade pimento cheese thinned to luxuriously smooth spread.

All small plates to this point, the smoker to my left emitting the appetizing wafts of pork and wood, it was with two larger plates served simultaneously that savories came to a close and although the golden chicken served with fragrant garlic and thyme was no doubt high quality next to toasty toothsome cornbread it was the veal and pork meatballs melded with buttermilk breadcrumbs that immediately captured my attention, the creamy polenta base equally perfect with housemade tomato sauce.

Greeted by the manager and seeing great teamwork from a staff that looks out for one another with regard to bussing plates and filling drinks there was no doubt dessert would follow a meal of such high grade, but limited to a lone housemade biscuit-dough doughnut topped in salty caramel it was in an outsourced option from The Pie Snob that true greatness was discovered, a lemony Chess Pie atop an all-butter crust on par with anything found in the Carolinas or Tennessee beneath a thick dollop of cream.",4,"[u' lovely place', u' happy hour', u' more knowledgeable', u' as rich', u' light salad', u' rich ham', u' luxuriously smooth', u' equally perfect', u' great teamwork', u' true greatness']",5.5,"[u' fried chicken', u' fluffy hushpuppies', u' small plates', u' golden chicken', u' thick dollop']",-1.5
AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw,"It's bit hard to locate, as other reviews have mentioned, but it does have a nice big parking lot, huge plus. The decor, as my boyfriend characterized it, is hipster 101 -- nothing original, but clean, comfortable, and welcoming. The house cocktails are phenomenal -- we had the Seabach, border-crosser, and a manhattan, and all were well balanced. The bartenders definitely know their stuff.

And the food is worth the trip -- the stacked salad is crisp, fresh, and properly dressed, and the pecans are a nice touch. The focaccia is really a pizza, which is not a problem for me, but set your expectations accordingly. The verde is quite good, the crust is properly charred, thin in the center with a large, fluffy cornicione. My one complaint would be that the ratio of rim to toppings is a bit off, and a bit more topping would be nice. The fried chicken is excellent, shatteringly crispy crust with moist, tender chicken underneath, and the cornbread that comes with it (while a bit sweet) is good companion. Ditto for the mussels, which are plump and cooked to appropriate doneness. And the housemade hot sauce is fantastic, but beware the totally open top to the bottle....

To start I got the pineapple propeller, which was so tasty, and really well balanced. Our table got an order of the smoked wings with white BBQ, tomato and watermelon salad, Calabrese pork (on greens), mussels with cornbread, fried chicken skins, and then for the main we all split the catfish.

I loved the mussels, the broth they were in I almost wanted to bathe in. The wings were really good, they were smoked and glazed really well. The fried chicken skin was delicious, especially with the house made hot sauce. My date loved the pork belly bites with the Calabrese chili sauce, he said the greens were the best he's ever had. The watermelon salad was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again cause it seems kind of common among valley eateries (the other salads I will definitely be ordering). I have to say the catfish was delicious. It was perfectly cooked and the succotash (sp?) was really good.

I understand the mix of flavors here, taking from the south and mixing with some Italian favorites. I have to say their happy hour eats and drinks are definitely worth a trip here.

Also, if it's your birthday you get a delicious donut with salted caramel sauce.

Returning to his background in southern inspired food, Chef Campbell has created one of the best-ever comfort food places in the Valley. Fried dilly beans (think wonderfully lightly tempura coating on fresh pickled green beans) with comeback sauce, smoked chicken wings that are served with ""homeboy's and white bbq sauce,"" potlikker mussels with cornbread that just begs to be swiped in a delicious broth, oysters al forno with garlic butter parsley and Noble bread, and a pimiento cheese burger with tomato and comeback sauce...served with fingerlings instead of fried....amazingly good!.

This time, we tried his Saturday special (he will always have a BBQ special on Saturdays) chicken served with mustardy potato salad and a Koollickle....yes...and it was delicious. While we typically don't have desserts out, a fresh pear brown sugar pie (whipped cream of course), and a canned biscuit doughnut with a salted caramel sauce was just so good.

1 star:  Never again.
2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.
3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.
4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.
5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.

Main point of comparison here is to Southern Rail here in the Valley, and I could compare it to some other Southern joints in the South on a dish-bu-dish comparison.  Both here and Southern Rail are 4 stars, but I give Okra the slight edge.

My wife and I love the food of Chef Cullen Campbell.  When we heard that Crudo would have a sister restaurant, it made total sense that he would go Southern.  (I can wax philosophically on the intersection of Southern, Italian, and Korean food for a while but I'll spare you.)

The bar program at Crudo is great, it's no less great here.  Especially if you are looking for whiskey and bourbon based cocktails.  (Secret which i don't really want to share - they have Pappy.)

We've ordered a fair amount of dishes off the menu, so here's a quick rundown:

'Nduja dates - Salty/sweet combo in a small sticky package, it is fine.
Fried head cheese - We're gettin' truly Southern here, and I would recommend you get this.
Calabrian pork bites and greens - A little heavy-handed as an app, it's rich and filling.
Fried chicken skins - These are tasty little treats.  Reminds me of the skins at Husk in Charleston.
Fried dilly beans - THIS IS THE ONE.  So, so great.  Comeback sauce, awesome.  
Smoked chicken wings - Quite tasty.  Not crispy at all, but the smoke on these suckers is great.
Bone marrow biscuits - We love marrow but this, too, was a little heavy-handed.  Very rich.
Pimento cheese burger - A sloppy mess but a decent burger.  Pimento could be a little stronger.
Tennessee hot chicken - Falls short of Nashville, but the chicken was not dry and it was spicy enough.
Chicken and dumplings - one of the best entrees here.  Chicken is flavorful as is the broth.
Smoked ham hock - Heavy and satisfying.  Don't think I cold eat it in the summer, but it is well smoked and the black eyed peas and greens round out a good Southern meal.

However, my experience was full of highs and lows. Unfortunately, mostly lows. We dined on Friday May 20 at about 7:30, on the patio (which was quite lovely). 
I started with the bright eye, bushy tail, on the recommendation of our server. So, I HATE dairy and in her description she never mentioned that there was dairy in it. Sure, I should have read the description so that was on me. I then ordered a sinister kid, which was delightful. 
We had the fried chicken skins and the hush puppies, which were both really tasty. I was quite happy with those. For my main, I ordered the Tennessee hot chicken, which was pretty awful, especially considering how wonderful the fried chicken skins are. First of all, I asked for a biscuit instead of cornbread, great. Well, the chicken arrived with pickles. Normally, if something seems as though it would come with pickles, I'd ask for them to hold the pickles, as they seep into whatever you're eating. But in what world would fried chicken come with pickles? The menu doesn't state this. So, the server (who was awesome) offered to get me a new plate, that was great. Unfortunately, when my plate was returned to me, my biscuit was covered in gravy. COVERED. Back to the dairy thing, I hate gravy. Had the menu said there was gravy, I would have asked for the biscuit without gravy. The gravy also got all over my chicken, and I wasn't about to complain about something else, so I just used my napkin to wipe as much off as I could. The chicken itself was cold and soggy. I have had Tennessee hot chicken plenty of times, and never has it been cold. It was also not spicy at all, which is kindof the whole point of ordering it. I tried my friends' dishes, the meatballs and the beef brasato, which were both far better than my cold chicken.
For dessert, we each had a donut, which was good, though very sweet. If you don't like sweet, you won't like this. It was almost too sweet for me, but it was pretty good. 
Overall, the starters were excellent, and the drink without dairy was delightful. I wish their menu was more informative and I wish my dish was served hot and not soggy.

However, we won't be going back. The food is too overpriced for what you get.

I grew up in the south and have lived there my entire life and never had such a terrible breading to meat ratio. I suspect that breading is cheap and chicken is expensive but, come one! Honestly, my kids get more actual chicken meat in the kids meal at Boston Market!

Also, they charge for hush puppies???? In the south, hush puppies are served free, like bread. 

Also, they don't accept reservations so we called ahead a couple of times to time our arrival when the wait was small. The hostess insisted they didn't take reservations but several tables had ""Reserved"" signs on them. When I asked the hostess, she told me that those were for ""special guests"". So, I guess that special guests can get reservations but I'm not sure what categorizes as special.

AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw,"We enjoyed our first dining experience at Okra's Cookhouse & Cocktails from start to finish!   The atmosphere was loud and friendly, the food, and especially our server, Morgan were wonderful! The menu offers a nice choice of very flavorful, Southern comfort food made with a variety of ingredients that heighten the food far from average. Southern food with a twist- far different from our South West flavors of Arizona.  
     Because my wife and I didn't recognize some of the ingredients and descriptions on the menu, we called our server over. She was extremely helpful and friendly- that Southern hospitality we've all heard of and is so sorely missing in most restaurants these days. In fact we spoke with three servers and one of the cooks (we were seated at a tall table, near the kitchen window)
     We enjoyed our food immensely, it was very fresh, flavorful and portions were generous.

AueEbb9kao4lt6CYt06hqw,"After circling around for a while because the sign for okra was out front but the entrance and the restaurant is in the back of the place I finally got here with my girlfriend and sat at the unassuming bar that looked like it was built out of one piece of wood for aesthetic purposes (it's not really wood I don't think). We were greeted by a friendly bartender who gave us two menus, one for okra's awesome drinks and the other for their even better food. I was not sure what I wanted to drink so the bartender asked what type of alcohol I liked and then recommended the dog howl day drink (or something of that nature). It contains bourbon and citrus and mezcal and was amazing. 


Now one thing about this place is it is not for people that are calorie counting or on a diet, it's for those of us who love good food. After drinks we proceeded to order food, and let me tell you their food is absolutely delicious, especially their fried chicken skins. I mean they take the best part of the chicken, batter it up, then deep fry it... Mmmmm makes my mouth water just thinking about this heart attack inducing appetizer, seriously a must have. I also had their brocollin with pistachio pesto and egg (one of the healthier things on the menu) and it was delicious, the egg is over easy so once you cut into it it mixes with the crispy brocollini and tastes amazing. Lastly we had the bone marrow with ox tail and biscuit, and as any good foodie place has a bone marrow okra's was divine. The ox tail sauce mixture was a perfect fitting with the bone marrow and biscuit. 

Overall this place is delicious and their take on southern style cuisine is a perfect mix of new age foodie hipster and old style delicious unhealthy fair.

Although not perfect but the service is good and personable. It is the food. Using southern dishes and trying to refine them and charge higher price for a refinement that actually basterdises the great cheaper igredients such as catfish, bone marrow, grits, ham hock, does not work. Almost everything is sweet,  from the tomato base of the small meatballs, to the base of the short rib and even the muscle broth.

We tried the divoli (?) flatbread which is basically a pepperoni pizza (very red peppery pepperoni).  The wings were seasoned well and grilled, though a bit too much.  They were tiny and a good portion of them were completely black on one side.  The fried cheese balls are actually fried mac and cheese balls.

The mussels were good too, but the cornbread it came with was ordinary. I had their shrimp and grits and thought it was okay.

I asked the waiter, I asked the kitchen, but they won't tell me what they put on those damn delicious pork rinds.

Okra brings a unique atmosphere to the midtown area with a combination of Southern comfort food, twists on Italian favorites, and a down-to-earth atmosphere that juxtaposes high quality ingredients with inviting hospitality. They could serve these craft cocktails and eclectic eats in an exclusive, dimly-lit lounge, but instead make it accessible, with its hard rock and sports. 

This could be a surprisingly good place to watch college football, just as long as they're not big on the SEC!

I indulged more in the safer side of the respectable cocktail menu. With prices as low as $6 a pop for some of these, it's an hour happier than most. Sazerac was on point. The milk punch was unique and refreshing, although it left me wanting for a little more depth beyond the delicious cognac. I cannot recall the tequila-based treat I enjoyed from the more premium concoctions, but it certainly left a great first impression.

The couple of appetizers I had were cool. This is the only place I've seen this side of the Mississippi rocking fried chicken skins. The honey hot sauce coating them is grand! I tried one of their focaccias, which are really pizzas, and while the ingredients were good, there was a bit of a flavor mismatch. Sweet and salty doesn't work with everything! Additionally, I couldn't imagine ever paying full price for these, as they're up to $14, which would certainly get you something bigger and better elsewhere. No worries, however, as there are lots and lots of options I am sure could please anyone.

I'll be back with a bigger appetite, and some cautious optimism for some twists on classic dishes.

The fiance´ and I have come to Okra twice now, and both times we've sat at the bar (everyone knows the bar is the best place in any restaurant). Let me just narrow down this review to our latest experience (hub's bday - and btw, I know he's not my hubs yet, but it's way easier and a lot less annoying to type, IMO).

Some highlights: the bartenders are so nice and SO talented. Their juleps are to die for!

Next, the apps: you shouldn't come here if you're not planning on getting appetizers. Just turn around and go home. The Fried Chicken Skins are unreal. Think about the best part of friend chicken, and then imagine having JUST that on a plate covered in spicy honey sauce. I die.

On to entrees: you can't go wrong with both styled of fried chicken. I always go for the Tennessee Hot because I like a little bit o' spice and the sauce is killer, but my hubs goes the Umbrian style (your regular run of the mill fried chicken) and it's equally delicious and fall-off-the-bone.

Lastly, and truly I'm saving the best for last, dessert: You have two options: you need to either go for the pie or go for the donut...

The pie is from Pie Snob (if you don't know about Pie Snob, look it up on Yelp RIGHT NOW, and then order an apple pie, and then thank me later).

The donut and pure caramel heaven. It's drenched (not drizzled) in the most delectable caramel sauce I've ever tasted, with just a pinch of sea salt to top it off. *drooling*

One pro tip before you come to Okra, since you're obviously making a reservation this very minute: it's a little hard to find.

Exception #1. Quality and presentation. The quality I get. I've come to expect nothing short of amazing from Chef Cullen & crew. All the dishes we sampled in our party of four were killer. Grilled Okra starter, shareable pleases: fried chicken skins (not as good as the signature fried pig ears at Crudo, but tasty nonetheless), mussels & cornbread (I could eat a loaf of the cornbread in a bowl of milk, so good!). Entrées: pig cheek pot pie, fried chicken Umbrian style, pork osso buco & braised beef rib. Finished everything off with a delicious caramel biscuit dessert. All very amazing. 
The bar area is smallish but well tended in a manner you would expect from these guys.

li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ,"I visited Hurry 4 Curry on a Saturday evening for a take away dinner. I believe I visited on their second or third day of operation.

I entered a restaurant with modern decor that was spotlessly clean. Having read about the restaurant in the Republic prior to arriving, I immediately headed towards one of the two flat screen televisions to place my order. Ordering was easy and quick and the menus offered descriptions of the Indian food for those who may be unfamiliar with the cuisine.

I ordered butter chicken, naan bread and Basmati rice. This came to $8.50. It was a pleasure to see, as is done in many other countries, that the tax was included in the price of each item. While I could have swiped my credit card to pay at the ""menu monitor,"" I chose to pay cash and received service from the friendly lady at the cash register. She also validated my parking in the AZ Center garage. My butter chicken (you can choose naan or rice as a side) was $7.50 and my naan was another dollar, which brought the total cost of my meal to $8.50. Because I was ordering take away, I did not order a drink. I did, however, see that the restaurant is applying for a liquor license; presumably for the sale of beer given that there is no ""bar"" in the quick service space.

After a wait of maybe five minutes, I received my food in what one might describe as ""higher-quality"" Chinese food boxes. The naan bread was wrapped in foil.

After a short drive home, I transferred my food from box to plate and began to enjoy my dinner. While the rice was very well cooked (generally fluffy and not clumped together), the naan (as the Republic also reported) was somewhat disappointing. While it was definitely naan and not pita bread, I found my serving to be almost cracker-like in texture and too cool of a temperature. (I assume this may be because the naan was prepared earlier in the day. I wonder, though, if they could have devised a way to warm the bread before serving in a convection oven?) My butter chicken was flavorful, but also rather cool in temperature. Portion sizes were more than adequate.

When I visited, the restaurant was empty. Because I hope this restaurant will survive (I think the concept is novel), I sent some of the concerns detailed above in the form of constructive criticism to the restaurant after eating my dinner. Would I return? Sure. I enjoyed a healthy, filling and flavorful dinner for a fair price.

The curry was pretty tasty.  Nothing amazing, but would satisfy an indian food craving.  The rice was sort of bland, and the naan was pretty terrible.  I like naan that can soak up some curry, but this naan was like a dry cracker.  It was sooooo thin.

The prices are excellent given the portions of food, which probably saves this place from being one-starred. And yes, the touch-tone screen system is pretty nifty and quick. Except... why would such a system draw me in in the first place? Who exactly is this technology targeting? I live downtown, just a few blocks away. Why would I (a) drive around in circles for 10 minutes looking for parking around the stupidly-designed Arizona Center so I can spend another 5 minutes walking in and getting a computer-aided Indian meal, or (b) walk 10 minutes from my place to do the same? I would much rather convince a friend to join me for a pleasant sit-down experience at a downtown Indian restaurant, where we can order samosas and Kingfishers and pig out on korma or CTM (chicken tikka masala).

As for the food, it's pretty meh. I was starving when I ordered my kadai chicken with rice, so I did wolf it down and was satisfied. But the flavor and richness of the meal was pretty average. Again, think mall food court.

Thursday evening I attended ""[title of show]"" at The Herberger (OYE) and decided I wanted to eat before the show.  I found out Amy B was going and I asked if she wanted to meet me somewhere close.  Arizona Center doesn't offer much in the way of cheap and quick and I wanted more than a sandwich.  I suggested this place and she said OK as she had not yet tried it either.

Ordering was simple.  The Kiosk had links to descriptions and stuff.  Without much going on in the place the folks working there seemed real busy without accomplishing anything, and we sort of got ignored for a few minutes at the counter.  And later, while we were eating, there seemed to be a bit of swapping of drinks and things with Mi Amigo's next door, and at one point one of the employees went around the corner and I think borrowed some foil pans from someplace.  I like the idea that friendly competitors will help each other out.  Also while we were eating the manager appeared and made the rounds of the tables to see how folks were doing.

Amy chose a butter chicken wrap and I ordered the butter chicken with rice ($7.75) and a soda ($1.50).  I don't eat much Indian/Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food so I didn't really have a lot to compare against.  My Americanized description is marinated chicken with rice covered in gravy.  The only difference would be the seasonings in the marinade and the gravy.  It was ok and a change from some of the more common fast food items.  It was, however, only lukewarm.  I think that has to do with a couple of things.  The food is kept warm in big clay pots and the choice of styrofoam plates.  Styrofoam doesn't handle high heat well but if they used paper it doesn't handle gravies very well.  They can't win on that one.  

I thought the meal was priced fairly given the location and the prep involved.  Given the choice of a similar cuisine I would choose Pita Jungle.  That isn't to say I would rule out going back here again if I was in the area.",3,"[u' friendly competitors', u' kept warm']",0.975,[],0

I for one love integers, so imagine my enthusiasm when they decided not to open a Hurry For Curry and instead opened a Hurry4Curry!

There's all sorts of reasons 2 feel lukewarm about Hurry4Curry.

1) The self-serve touchscreens.  Are people really that excited about this?  Have they never touched an iPod?  I don't understand the thrill of being your own check-out person (a la the grocery store).  Isn't that what the people behind the counter are being paid to do?  And I get to do it for free?

2) A rotating menu.  Look, I can't tell vindaloo from biryani from Benny Agbayani (that's a baseball zing).   So I don't have Indian food favorites.  But IF I did, I think I'd find it really frustrating if I went in and my favorite thing was unavailable just because the owner/cooks are bored.  

3)  Maybe the prices are good.  Maybe they're not.  My meal, drink and naan was 481.11 rupees.  Err, excuse me.  Ten dollars and fifty cents.  It doesn't feel like a good deal for fast food.

The postiives?  Naan bread was warm and delicious.  Some added variety to an Arizona Center devoid of culinary inspiration.  (People: please stop going to Hooters.  Two worst meals of my life.)  Also, did I mention this already?  They have an integer in their name.

There's plenty to like, theoretically, but our experience  here was one and done. We arrived early evening, before a ballgame.  It seemed a little off peak, like maybe the B team was on duty. 

We ordered via the touch screen, and after a couple tries, generated a receipt.  Then waited a long while for ""fast food"", and it seemed longer because you dont get a human confirmation that it's even in progress.

li6HgKl6mEhZpdMgAIQoOQ,"Hurry for Curry, then wait. It took 25 minutes for me to get my order. Don't get it confused with the chain Curry in a Hurry, that would imply they are quick. Also don't get it confused with Naan and Curry in San Francisco, because then it would be cheaper, faster and better.
This is the second time I've eaten here. The first time I had the chicken curry (which took awhile too). Also, I was confused, because I thought Indian Curry is usually thick like a paste. This curry was extremely watery. Also, I was confused because they gave me a tiny little piece of undercooked bread, which I guess was supposed to be the naan.
The second time was when I had to wait (longer I mean). When I finally got my order, my extra order of naan wasn't ready. Although they certainly had enough naan for everyone else. I sat down, finished my food, and sure enough no extra naan. The naan I had was still undercooked, so I thought they would just under cook the extra too, since they don't bother to finish cooking it fully.
Furthermore, what's with the ordering through computers? Are they meant to save time? Or look cool? The line is always backed up with people navigating thru menus on these. Also, with the automated ordering machines, they should have extra man-power in the kitchen right? Nope.
Seriously, this is Indian food gone wrong. Next time you have a curry craving go for any of the great Indian restaurants in the valley, I've liked all the ones I've tried. Or if you're downtown, go next door to the Mexican restaurant, the pizza place, or (never thought I'd say this) Subway. If you have the time hop over to Breadfruit or Pastabar.

6SfNZP1oqiQV1AYLK9A8WA,"There are few places that do comfort food as well as Long Wongs. 

This isn't a first date kind of place - there must be a clause in the Long Wong franchise that stipulates that any Long Wongs needs to be a complete and utter dive. I've never seen a single reputable looking LW establishment, but don't let the appearance deceive you - Long Wongs is a diamond in the rough.

The piece de resistance of every Long Wongs is their chicken wings. I'd like to believe that nowhere else on the planet could you find a more perfect blend of crispy, saucy, tasty wings. I've never had wings anywhere else that came close to being as good. I've tried most of their flavors, but my favorite is Honey Mustard. It's a perfect blend of sweet, spicy, sticky goodness. Other great flavors are Teriyaki, Honey BBQ, Honey Hot, and Medium.  

I've had their deep fried zucchinis, mushrooms, and their corn dogs (Foster Farms) and they're all delicious.

A dozen wings for $7-8 bucks isn't a bad deal at all. I've done larger orders for family get-togethers and work potlucks and the wings consistently get rave reviews. If you want good wings, you're not going to find anything better and you'll only end up paying more, save yourself the trouble and go to Long Wongs.

I'd recommend phoning in your order ahead of time otherwise it can be a 10 minute wait (and make sure you have the correct location).

6SfNZP1oqiQV1AYLK9A8WA,"The most awesome experience I've had with wings came in Atlanta back in like 94' or something.  There was this little shack outside our hotel that sold a dozen wings for like $6 or something.  They were the best wings I've ever had.  Fried perfectly and with a sauce hot enough to know I'm eating buffalo wings but tasty as well.  We must have gone through at least 9 dozen wings.  No exaggeration.

Long Wong's wings are the first to remind me of that little shack.  Partly because it really is a little shack itself.  But the wings there are simple and effective, something that I haven't found in a buffalo wing since.

Sure the place is a dive, but what else does it need to be?  You're in the middle of Phoenix.  You're hungry for wings.  You don't need Native New Yorker type atmosphere.  You just need wings that are good and won't break the bank.  Long Wong's ain't pretty, but they fit the bill for some affordable and top-notch grub.

They've got some other things on the menu...a couple chinese dishes and some stuff that I can't remember now.  Its not important.  You come here for wings.  Oh, there are burgers that people seem to enjoy as well.  Maybe I'll check them out next time.  Little joints like this tend to have good burgers for some reason...nice and greasy!

Anyway, for under 7 bucks you can get a dozen wings.  If you're a kind person, the lady behind the counter can tell...she'll give you a free ranch.  If you come in there with an attitude or like the rest of the world is here to serve you, you get no free ranch.  She doesn't say much, she doesn't smile much, but she gave me free ranch.  So she's a saint in my book.
It took about 7 minutes to get my food, which is perfect when I'm on a quick lunch.  There was one other person in front of me, so that's really a good time frame.  I have to mention that it was cash only...don't know if this is all the time, but that day there was a sign stating no plastic.  A small inconvenience.  There's about 5 chairs in there so you'll probably be standing around while waiting.  I guess there is a back area you can wait in, too.  Though it looks as if you're not supposed to be in there or something.  

Got my little styrofoam container and got back to the desk.  I opened the lid and the smell of correctness filled my cubicle and drifted throughout the office.  The aroma took me back to that little shack.
Presentation was surprisingly included here.  They had the little red and white paper in there on the bottom of the container, and celery and stuff, too.  Nice touch.
I grabbed a wing.  It was crispy.  Heavy.  Big.  A real piece of chicken.  Not those mini-wing dings I've gotten at some inappropriate places.
Took a bite.  
Heaven.
I was back in Atlanta in 1994.
I was amazed and utterly pleased.  This was the buffalo wing I'd been patiently waiting for since the shack.  And I found it not at Native's.  Not Buffalo Wild Wings.  Not anywhere else but a little hole in the wall joint called Long Wong's.  
Life is full of quirky surprises.
Crunchy.  Even after they'd sat in the sealed container steaming while I went to purchase a beverage.
Juicy.  The chicken was cooked to perfection, no undone or overdone stuff here.
Tasty.  Delicious isn't a great enough word.  These wings were simply perfect.  The sauce (i saw the lady pour it out of one of many jugs they have in the back) is honest and humble and simple and real.  No frilly stuff.  No Sweet and Sassy this, or 5 Alarm that.  Just some good stuff.  I'd eat a tire if you fried it and put this stuff on it.
What more could you ask for?  There is nothing fancy about Long wong's whatsoever.  Just the perfect wings.  I noticed some awards posted around the joint for their wings.  Rightly so.  To get the best tasting wings in the city for this price makes this joint my new indulgence.  So long, diet.

6SfNZP1oqiQV1AYLK9A8WA,"When I first moved the Valley of the Sun, back in the mid-90's, my wife and I used to frequent a place called the Native New Yorker. Now, I know - the Native New Yorker is still around, but not like they used to be. You see, back in the day (wow - I'm sounding old) the Native New Yorker was known for one thing: Wings. That's because their wings were....wait for it....10 cents each. That's right - 10 cents. 15 cents if you wanted to upgrade to honey BBQ. So it was not uncommon to sit down and have tables around you with mountains of wings. We would settle in with friends and buy 100 wings (for $10!), then eat our way to a glorious food coma.

Now, I realize those days are long gone. After all, it was 20 years ago and now wings cost more per pound that breasts. Knowing this, I still cringe when I go somewhere and have to shell out $9 for 6-8 wings. Call me cheap (You wouldn't be the first). So I was happy to find Long Wong's on Thomas. No they're not 10 cents, not even close, but they are pretty cheap and they deliver better than average flavor.

Located on the SE corner of 7th Avenue and Thomas, next to an abandoned mini-mart, this run-down, garish pink shack serves up a variety of wings along with a number of other favorites.

Now if you're looking for a reasonably clean, nicely furnished eatery with some ambience, then don't go here. As another reviewer noted, the restroom is locked with a padlock. With all due respect, I probably wouldn't want to eat here - this is strictly a take-out dive. But don't let that scare you. Come for the food - you'll be glad you did.

On this last visit, I ordered a dozen BBQ wings. I had asked them to go light on the sauce, as they sometimes have a tendency to go a little overboard. They still went overboard. The wings were drenched in a sweet, tangy BBQ sauce. I wiped what I could off and enjoyed every single bite.

I also ordered a side of vegetable fried rice. It was a healthy portion (healthy is probably not the right word) that is probably intended to serve a small family. I ate about half of it. It was delicious - almost as good as the fried rice that my mom makes. And that means a lot.

They also have standard lunch menu items - burgers, fries, etc. but with all the wing choices, don't bother.

All in all, I am happy that Long Wong's is around to provide a great value on better-than-average wings. They provide food like your mom might make (if your mom was an elderly Asian woman) at a fair price. And they do care about making you happy.

Pizza clearly doesn't need to be cooked in a brick oven to be delicious; the proof is right here.  Brick oven pizza is cooked in a brick oven, and it has a distinct texture based on the unique method of cooking.  This is not brick oven pizza, and it doesn't even resemble brick oven pizza - not in cooking style, not in texture, and not in taste.  It's still delicious (five star delicious).  I don't understand where the ""brick oven"" came from unless there's some crazy story about how they were going to install a brick oven, but it broke as it was being shipped from Italy and the sign had already been ordered.

Service was prompt and quick, and very nice. She brewed a new pot of decaf for me.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"What brings me to the Biltmore once a year is the ""Hell City"" tattoo expo. So if your visiting on that particular weekend, be prepared for some low brow meets high brow juxtapositions. I chuckle a little at the sight of the yuppie golfers and high maintenance housewives being outnumbered by the extreme body modification crowd. Like Jorge Casulties' mohawk, the grounds are immaculately maintained, and taking in the architecture is an experience in itself. I had fun discovering the plethora of fruit trees around campus. Unfortunately, the oranges were inedible, but look around and you'll find kumquats, limes, and pomegranate. But you probably aren't going to the Biltmore for it's foraging opportunities. The restaurant also has delicious offerings, but you will pay an average of $35 for an entree. All of the staff from landscapers to servers to desk reception do a great job of appearing happy and friendly, and that helps us to feel that all is right in the world during our stay. The rooms are spacious and clean, but the fixtures might show minor signs of their age. The fridge is stocked with goods priced four times over their market value. Throw them in a drawer, and use the refrigerator for the drinks and snacks you thought to buy ahead on your way in. 
What I don't like about staying here is that the campus is so secluded from town. It is a 2 mile walk to outside restaurants and stores. But if you aren't wearing bottom beaded moccasins, stroll south to East Camelback road, and you will find a variety of eateries to suit anyone's taste. On the east side of the campus, there is a pedestrian / bike trail that takes you halfway there. I personally enjoyed Revo Burrito and True Food's fresh juices and their gluten free conscious menu. Neither place delivered, but they should consider doing so.

Also, you may want to know that you can navigate a bus ride from the airport for $6 or less. A cab will cost $40 - $60. Consult www.valleymetro.org to plan your route, and be prepared to walk about a mile from the stop to the reception desk. Once there, you can rent a bike at the Biltmore, but it will cost $15 per hour or $50 per day.

One of my colleagues inquired how much a massage at the spa would be. Upon hearing the price, he replied, ""Thank you, I'll massage myself!"" We laughed.

As you may have suspected, my normal state of being is in jeans, T shirt and a pony tail. I bought a colorful maxidress and had my hair done did, and It felt right for my weekend stay at the Biltmore. I didn't look like the glamour models on the website, but, heck, not too many people do.

There are 8 pools spread around the property and they each seem to have a different atmosphere. The two pools we went to were the large ones right in the middle of the property with the slide and the swim-up bar. If you have some extra cash, get yourself an $8 beer (!) in the bottle. Otherwise, bring your own. The slide is fun. It doesn't go as fast as I'd like but it's something to do at the pool. The big downside at the pools is that the hot weather heats them up so much that they should actually be cooled off. They were probably 90 degrees... bath water. Not as refreshing as you'd like them to be.

The buildings and rooms are very nice, clean, spacious, neat and comfortable. I could have taken a nap all day in our room. One drawback is that some buildings and rooms are far from the parking lot. You have quite a ways to walk if you don't valet.

The receptionist wrote down my room number on a Post-It and assured me that I would have hot water the next time I took a shower. I rushed off to my meetings, glad they were on the case.
However, I came back to my room on lunch, around 2pm, and found that though it was clear someone had been there (they left the TV and lights on), I still had no hot water. So I went to complain again before my afternoon meetings began. Once again, the receptionist wrote down my room number on a Post-It, and assured me they would get the hot water working.
After the day's meetings, I checked my room again and still: no hot water.
When I complained this third time, the receptionist once again pulled out the Post-It's and wrote down my room number. I was like, ""Whatever you're doing by writing down my room number isn't working. I need a new solution.""
So they found me a new room and it did have hot water. Yay.

Wow, this place is fancy to just give those away, I thought! But no, when I was located to my next room I discovered that in THIS room, the bottle had an $8 price tag on it. They had left that off of the first room (shameful omission!). Not only that, but when whoever it was that had been in my room earlier, they had taken my half-drunk bottle of Fiji water and disposed of it! All well and good if the water is free, but if you charge $8 for it, you cannot toss it from your customer's room!
So, anyway, the grounds are rather striking to see, especially for architecture buffs, but the interiors of both rooms left me a little bit shocked at how much disrepair the place had fallen into. The cabinet housing my first room's fridge appeared to have a rotting floor. Chips, cracks, and peeling wallpaper was abundant. The place could use a good tune-up to bring it back to a level of quality that befits its legacy.
The staff in general were amazingly attentive and great to deal with and for their extremely good face they bump this awful two-night's stay up to a ""3"". They even removed the $8 charge for the price-tag-less bottle of Fiji water without letting me finish my sentence of complaint.",3,"[u' hot water', u' even warm', u' hot water', u' hot water', u' hot water', u' hot water', u' hot water', u' good tune-up', u' amazingly attentive', u' extremely good']",3.9,"[u' little bit', u' awful two-night']",-1.1875

Parking: what a mess!  $12 to self-park and it takes forever to get to the garage or other lot.
Lighting:  They're doing some construction, and at night it's downright dangerous since all the lights are off.  Nearly tripped several times.
Location of room relative to hotel: The property is huge!  My room was all the way in the back.  I should have packed a small meal; I almost went missing on my walk from the parking lot back to the room.  Without exaggeration, it's easily 1/4 mile.

Pros:
- the public areas are incredible; the stunning lobby is worth a half hour sit to take it in
- the pools areas are some of the best in Arizona (which have some of the best in the world)
- most of the staff seems to be 4 star trained, which is hard to find in the relaxed Arizona resort row
- the history of the hotel is unmatched in the state. You'll find cool touches in unexpected places (e.g. there's a Nancy and Ronald Reagan registration card with notes about their honeymoon in the room service menu). FLW is everywhere you look.
- the fitness center is one of the best I've ever seen at a hotel, and it was free.
Cons:
- MAN are these rooms shabby!  I've stayed several times and toured 4 suites in preparation for a meeting.  All rooms are worn down, but this review is of the last stay in 2126
- the carpets are worse than frayed, there's actually a crease running the length of the room
- the two nightstands, table, desk, and TV stand all are warped and peeling motel 6 style
- the bathtub is worn and needs be glazed or resurfaced
- the outdated leather headboard had had holes in it
- every surface is scuffed - even the ceiling!
- there was one front desk clerk for much of the stay.  Very difficult to get them to answer the phone and/or help with anything
- no in room coffee.  This a resort practice of the PAST.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"**There are two different listings for this property.  Also search Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa to see the other listings.

The first time I stayed here was 6 years ago and I had a great visit so when I found myself back in Phoenix I knew exactly where I would stay.  I am sad to say that my experience this time was horrible.  

I got to the hotel around 8;30 pm and still had to eat and had work to do.  I got to my room and I started sweating.  It was 100 degrees outside and even hotter in the room.  I called down to the front desk and got the response that there are dials on the air conditioning I can turn it up.  When I asked to speak to the manager he said there wasn't a manager there.  His solution was to have me follow a bell man from room to room until I found one that would work for me.  I immediately hung up the phone and went to the front desk.

At the front desk I talked to a woman who got the manager right away.  I explained the situation and told him that I was going to dinner and that when I returned I expected my luggage in a room that was at a habitable temperature. 

My room was changed and the air conditioner did work in the new room but my experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  I understand that the guy I talked to was very young (it was the same guy that checked me in) but there are major training issues here. 

The second issue that I faced was that I was charged $26.80 after I checked out for the mini bar.  I never touched the mini bar!  (I did have free Waldorf Astoria branded water coupons of which I did take and I did leave the coupon for). Are you kidding me? It was a good thing I went online and checked the bill they posted which is something that I never do but this hotel was just off. I got the same manager that helped me with my room issue.  He said he would reverse the charges. No apology. 

The third thing that happened is I accidentally left the do not disturb sign on the door so I had to call housekeeping to have my room made up. I was in the room while the housekeepers were there.  I was working on my computer and making phone calls since and no one came on the first phone call I made to housekeeping.  The second call an hour and a half later after I returned from lunch is what brought someone to my room.  I asked for an extra bag of coffee which they gave me. I also asked for extra lotion since my skin was not used to the hot dry Arizona weather.  They went to the cart and said they didn't have anymore.  Sorry.  I literary looked at them like they were at another planet.  They went to walk away and I said, ""You don't have any in the entire hotel?"" To which one of the ladies replied we'll have to go get it and stared at me.  OK was my response.  When she returned she handed over one little bottle of lotion to which I thanked her.

I was very surprised with my experience here.  I would have gotten better service at any of the other Hilton Brands.  This is not the way the Hilton runs hotels and I sincerely hope they can turn this hotel around.  The Waldorf Astoria properties are among my favorite and to see this happen is horrible. The Arizona Biltmore used to be such a great place.  The grounds are beautiful, the restaurants on the property had good food and I feel in love with the Salvatore Ferragamo Tuscan Soul scent of products they use.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I'm a frequent traveler and stay in Hiltons whenever I can.  I decided to stay at the Biltmore because of the great rates in the summer.  I have stayed at Waldorfs before and have enjoyed the comforts and amnemities they offer.  

Walking into the building was unexpected because it was very dark and you had to find your way to the front desk which was not near the front entrance.  Once your eyes adjusted, the architect is wonderful.  I wish that the lighting was brighter to fully enjoy the it.  Wright was a genius in design.  Once at the desk, there was only one person and a long line of people.  I'm a Hilton Diamond member and use to not waiting.  In the other Waldorfs there is a separate area for Hilton Honor members and they have everything ready for your arrival.  So after waiting in line for 30 minutes it was my turn to check in.  The desk attendant was friendly and helpful.  She gave me a map of the property and instructions on where to park my car and how to get to my room.  This is where the hotel gets my 2 star rating.  I like to park in self parking since as I said before I don't like to wait.  Sometimes valet service can be busy.  Well, the self parking lot was a distance from my room.  I had a room in the Terrace building which is in the far back of the hotel.  There is no parking anywhere but in the front of the hotel for valet and the self parking.  Walking from the parking lot to my room in 110 degree weather was not my idea of fun or relaxing.  The map that I was given has all the buildings but it doesn't have the walkways.  The signs on the property are not very helpful.  Walkways split and they don't always have signs where to go.  If you choose the wrong direction you end up at a deadend.  These are not deadends in which you can just walk across the grass to get on another path.  They are deadends that come to a side of a building, fence or ravine.  The whole time I'm walking around, I never see a hotel staff member.  I finally find my building and get on the elevator.  The elevator has no air conditioning and I have just entered an oven.  Now I'm thinking, why didn't I just stay at the Hampton Inn.  The room was ok.  Nothing special, not any different than a Hampton.  The furniture was old but everything was neat and appeared clean.  I go to plug in my Ipad and computer to find that there are very few electrical plugs and many of them don't even work.  Thank goodness I travel with an extension cord (frequent traveler).  The air conditioner control is one of the old kind and I could never get it set so the room was a comfortable temperature.  It was either too cold or too warm.  I was constantly getting up to adjusted it.  The bed was comfortable but when I woke in the morning, the first thing I see is an ant crawling across the sheet.  Ok, its just an ant, it could be worse.  I go into the bathroom to find more ants (call to front desk).  The shower doesn't drain correctly and minor housekeeping issues creep up.  

One thing I did like was the food.  It was very good.  I'm not a food person, I eat because I have too so I'm very picky.  But the food was great.  I recommend the Mega Grilled Cheese.  Its a heart attack waiting to happen but it was great.  UPDATE:  I guess it depends on when you order food.  I had the Mega Grilled Cheese for lunch and it was awful.  The bacon wasn't cooked and the cheese wasn't heated enough to even melt.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I was here for a business conference, Thursday-Saturday.  We arrived early (around 11am) and they were able to check us in without any hassle at all.  I think their normal check-in time is 4pm.  The service was great, very helpful in pointing out where everything was on the map.  This was a plus because the Arizona Biltmore has many separate buildings on their massive grounds.  

The lobby was nice and airy with lots of places to sit.  I also noticed a restaurant and a bar.  Walking outside, there are lounge chairs and cabanas for those who didn't mind the heat.  For being in the desert, the AB was definitely very green.  Lots of grass, palm trees and shrubbery to highlight the beautiful resort grounds.

The architecture here is also amazing.  Definitely look at the details in the stones, glass, walkways, doorways, and almost everywhere else.  It's quite entrancing.  

We took the short trek to our room (it was a trek because the weather was about 100 degrees and rising).  I opened the door to my room and was pleasantly surprised by the size.  It's larger than the usual hotel rooms but with all the nice amenities (flat screen, internet, king size bed with lots of thread count sheets, etc...).  Typical hotel room decor -- just lots of open space (enough for me to do a cartwheel).  The bathroom was equally nice and roomy as well.  They have a separate shower and bathtub.  There are 2 sinks and I liked the stone tiles on the ground.  The towels were very soft and the robe was a nice touch (even though it dwarf me with the sleeves hanging past my fingertips and the length practically dragging on the ground...).

I was sad I didn't have much time to enjoy the ""resort"" part of the hotel though.  Their golf course/putting greens was beautifully manicured (although I don't play golf); the pool areas were all very inviting and kept beckoning me to just jump in -- business suit and all.  And I probably would have, if not for the fact that I can't swim.  Darn.

I did get to enjoy the food and bar though.  The food for the conference was surprisingly good.  We even had a petite filet mignon dish that was very nicely cooked and flavored.  The bar was nice -- but expensive.  Mixed drinks were about $12 - $14.

Room service was impeccable, the concierge was knowledgeable and courteous, and the conference went well.  I truly enjoyed my stay here -- sans the scorching temperature of course.

I chose to visit the AZ Biltmore Spa for an aromatherapy facial and even after I read some negative reviews on Yelp about it, I went anyway.  I figured that I'd make my own consumer decision.  

Once I got passed the road sign that indicated where to go, there were no more signage so I was left clueless. THIS PLACE IS HARD TO FIND. I parked my car and headed in the wrong direction.  After walking for a few minutes, a young man who worked there asked me if I was lost and then told me I needed to head back in the other direction.  However, he was nice enough to let me ride back with him on his golf cart.  It's a good thing that I came early.  Let me just say that, if this guy did not find me in time, I wouldn't have found this place.  IT WAS LOCATED BEHIND THE TENNIS COURT WITH NO SIGNS SAYING SO.

My final thoughts: I had a great facial massage by Anne but just like one Yelp Naysayer had said, ""it's not your mama's spa. It's your grandmama's spa."" It wasn't hot, trendy or that much inviting.  It felt old and cold. So, I ended up paying $77 for the facial.  Why I paid that much for a $50 treatment? Because $27 was the gratuity that was included.  That's more than the 20% I was willing to pay.

I originally checked into a room in the older part of the hotel which turned out to be excessively loud because of some unknown noise.

Thankfully, my friend who was staying there arrived at 7:30 am to get the last 2 open lounge chairs. The pool is very small in relation to some of the other newer resorts in the area. Normally, I like a crowded and bustling pool scene, but when the crowd consists of 75% children squirting their water guns my direction, I'll pass. The bar didn't open until 11am, which doesn't score them any points, either, especially considering that I had to put up with 100+ screaming 8 year olds ruining my tan. As the day progressed and the sun intensified, my friend asked for an umbrella no fewer than 3 times before getting someone to move one her direction.

From the valet service to the poolside servers you can't go wrong with the Biltmore. I personally want to thank 99 percent of the staff for making it an outstanding example of Arizona hospitality.

A few suggestions...  Any meals you eat are great. Prices are quite reasonable. If you eat at the pool or room service expect a 40.00 tab. The buffet in the morning is quite good and expect 20.00 per head. If you can swing it go valet, we parked in the structure and it was a bit of a walk but all out luggage has wheels so not an issue.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Was here for a West Coast Swing dance competition over the 4th of July holiday weekend.  http://www.gpsdc.com/July4thMenu.htm
We would only be able to afford it during the sweltering summer with the temperature hitting 116 degrees.  $109 convention rate with 2, $5 off drink tix when you check in.  Internet in rooms free.  Free parking, paid by our convention, limited parking near the hotel rooms, but a large parking structure near the Frank Lloyd Wright Ballroom.   30% off a la carte spa treatments.  15% onsite restaurants.

I had a 1pm spa treatment that they moved to 3:00pm on Friday, will go into details of the spa in a separate review.  http://www.yelp.com/biz/hDMTdd4_YWcuSlWnVyMLkw#hrid:0hBSzjOpU8kZGfhe82VLbg 

Checked in around 6:30pm on Friday and was helped immediately, no lines and the interior of the lobby was so nice and cool with its carved rock columns.  My room was originally in bumf**k, the Golf View rooms, since my friends checked in on Thursday, they moved my rooms to the Paradise Wing, off of the main Paradise pool where our cabana and the water slide was located.

The hotel room in the Paradise Wing was average but must admit the bathtub is longer then the standard size.  There is a mini bar fridge in the room and they will charge you $25 to have it emptied for your use for your own things.  The carpets are a little worn and the bed was a little too soft for me, must have been the feather bed.  AC was fine.

We rented a cabana for 3 days, around $200 each day, you get a bathroom, shower, table for 4, fridge, two covered chaise lounges near the pool.  Free water and pitchers of ice.  Misters.  We brought our own snacks and kept them in our little ante room.  They don't allow you to decorate your cabana, food service stops at 6pm and the cabana closes at 10pm but you have access to it.  Well worth the rental in that heat and ours was right next to the steps, so very convenient to the pool.  Ordered lunch one day, had the hamburger and teriyaki chicken salad, both were good, around $14 each.  The staff is very busy, so you have to flag them down for service.

Friday night was smore making night at the large bonfire at the Squaw Creek Lawn, too hot for me but during the fall and winter, should be wonderful.  

Saturday night at 8pm, they had a poolside movie where you can watch from  inner tubes and floaties in the pool or lounges along the pool.  They played Madagascar our night and it was great fun.  Some complained of mosquitos but I didn't get bit until Sunday night at 2am at the pool, then I got around 8 bites.

Sunday day, near the pool was a fresh salsa making demo, so plenty and chips and salsa and cinnamon crispies to knosh on at the cabana.

The FLW ballroom was icy cold and the bathrooms were nearby and neat.    And ample room with a 5000 sq. ft. dance floor, tables and seating for 1000 dancers from across the US, Canada, UK, New Zealand and Australia.  Had a bit of a snafu on Sunday night, the hotel needed some of our ballroom, so were breaking down the ballroom floor while we were late night dancing but we all worked it nonetheless.

There isn't anything within walking distance so you need a car but a couple of miles away is a large mall with restaurants and a movie theater across the street.  Around 20 minutes from the airport.

A couple of complaints are the distance of walking from the sleeping rooms to the FLR ballroom, overcharge on my bill and the mosquitos at night.  The mosquitos are really bad, the hotel was telling people that they were spraying but with them watering all the lawns at night and the ponds, they were infested, even in the rooms.  So take insect repellent.  We would call the jutneys to take us from our hotel room to the ballroom and visa versa, so that was a nice work around.  When I saw the cabana overcharge, they fixed it at the front desk.

The staff was friendly even though overworked and overwhelmed by all of us dancers there.  The grounds are beautiful and lush and green.  The food was pricey but good and the spa was great.

Like they give you a Keurig and coffee but no little creamers? Powder creamer? Really?  I'm a Diamond member- didn't even give me a bottle of water when I checked in. 
Went to the pool today and had to flag down a waiter. Food was mediocre. Had what was called a chopped wedge. It was nothing more than lettuce with croutons and egg. Didn't see an ounce of blue cheese. Then, I had to go find the guy to get my check. 
The most annoying thing was a worker outside at 6:15 am hammering away at something. Are you kidding me?  At least I was up
The only good part was the facial at the spa. She did a good job. Not worth 155 bucks but at least my skin looks good   Ladies locker smelled awful, too

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Should have read the reviews before booking!  This is definitely not the level of service we expected for a 5-star hotel.  We had less than a five minute wait at the front desk, but it took the front desk over 20 min to check us in, then we were given poor directions to Paradise.  Upon entering our room we found dirty dishes on the floor, but the room had been cleaned, so I believe it was an oversight by the housekeeper.  The room was a king room with a balcony, however we were hard pressed to find a place to sit or put our luggage!  The reservation said marble bath, I guess they were talking about the vanity, because there was no bath, only a shower.  Immediately upon entry we telephoned guest services for champagne flutes and an ice bucket as we were celebrating and wanted to have a glass and get to the pool while the sun was still shining...30 min later I had to call again, and again we waited.  Finally after almost 45 min we received the champagne flutes and two ""plastic beer cups"" for the pool.  At this level of service could they not provide plastic champagne flutes for the pool; I mean we weren't exactly drinking Cold Duck?! 

Looking for an elegant and celebratory dining experience for the evening, and not wanting to leave the premises, we attempted to make dinner reservations at the resort's upscale restaurant, Wright's, only to be told they are not open on Sunday evenings.  Are you kidding me?  The concierge made a few suggestions and made a dinner reservation at a restaurant offsite, however we ended up canceling opting instead for room service; which I can say was pretty decent, but then again we had brought our own champagne and wine.

Arriving at the pool we were told we needed to go to another area to retrieve pool towels, the look on my face must have said it all because the bar manager said, ""hold on,"" and promptly came back with four fresh towels and did not ask for our pool towel cards.  The Paradise pool was nice, and I liked the fact it had an ""adults only"" section, however the jacuzzi was dirty and the jets were not functioning.

The bed was comfortable, but we were on the top floor and you would have thought there was a room above us running the shower all evening.  I have no idea what the sound was, but I had a fitful night's sleep; the sound was deafening.

This morning we had an early flight and needed to check out at 4:30 a.m. We called down for the car so as not to wait, and yes...we waited.  The bellman apologized profusely telling us he was the only attendant on duty!  If you have not visited this resort to say it is HUGE is an understatement!  This resort is significantly understaffed, and lacks the professionalism and quality touches an establishment at this level should have. 

Management did attempt to extend the olive branch by sending up a fruit plate and two bottles of water.  While the gesture was appreciated it hardly made up for the lack of attention to the details.  

Bottom line:  At close to $500 for one night (including taxes and resort fees), you should definitely be getting something more than what you receive!!  I guess it goes to show that it's the company you keep that makes the occasion and I am blessed to have been with someone special, so in spite of the disappointments the only thing that mattered was who I was with and that made the evening enjoyable.",2,"[u' pretty decent', u' own champagne', u' fresh towels', u' top floor', u' significantly understaffed']",1.983333333,"[u' poor directions', u' dirty dishes']",-1
v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I couldn't agree more with Fly I. The front-end experience leaves a lot to be desired. It's Hilton-managed and Morgan-Stanley owned, so one should expect more, or perhaps not. It's not Kimpton service, that's for sure:

Our room was robbed. The management reaction was professional (i.e., what had to be done was done), and that's it--no high-touch, no check-in a day later to see if everything was OK, no offer to replace stolen goods (""we need to hear back from our insurance company"").

The wait staff at Frank & Alberts was great, but the maitre d's were pretty clueless--one night, they didn't want to seat us in the garden because they ""had just seated 50 people."" We insisted, but they kept wanting to seat us in the stuffy bar--somehow, that would work better.... Finally, they gave in, and sat us in the back. Our waitron said she had four tables, and didn't know what the front was talking about. That pretty much sums up the disconnect at Ariz. Biltmore.

The happy hour at F&A's is great, if uneven--one night the mojito is weak, the next night it's wicked strong. I ordered a vodka gimlet and got a vodka lemonade.... But if you don't like the drink, the wait-staff will happily have a new one made. High concept: you want to overtip the staff, and short-change the hotel.

I didn't appreciate the restaurant hall monitor asking me if I had paid for the said seafood buffet either. Real amateur hour here.

Like many of the large Phoenix hotels, their bread and butter is the convention crowd and as we threaded our way from the tiny parking lot to our room passing through at least 3 crowded pools we passed a large outdoor space all set up for some big reception. Not quite the romantic retreat I was hoping for and to make matters worse for the past month I was convinced we were staying at the boulders (another Waldorf Astoria property-who knew there were two), and we even drove all the way up there 45 min north of Phoenix before realizing our mistake.

You can get several different kinds of massage at the spa. I'm a Swedish girl, all the way. And after an hour long massage they practically had to mop me up and wring me into bed. It was just that good.

He had one lady helping him which was not enough at all.  You could tell everyone was highly annoyed by the length of time everything was taking.  The entire tea experience took 2 hours 45 min and that was with us asking for our check ASAP to speed things along.  Our tea was also not poured for us once by the staff; which is usually done at least once during tea.

The food was ok--first course did have some good sandwiches but the ones with bread were totally dry.  The warm scones were good but took 40 min to get to us and that was asking the waiter twice for them. The chocolate pound cake which was totally ""talked up"" was fair (dry with not a lot of flavor).

We really do enjoy going to tea but this is not the first time we have gone there and had a bad experience.

Agnes of God! Seriously, I thought? How will this pan out? Well, Rickie and I had a gorgeous second story cottage. Which was a large, beautiful suite overlooking fountains, flowers and fanatics. First jab at the religious folks. We spent the afternoon poolside drinking mojitos, pina coladas, and Dos XX. Anytime the swarm of God's children splashed or came to us in the pool, we chanted ""Too closey, no splashy."" They did some sort of sign of the cross thing and off they swam. Jab number two. The poolside service was outstanding...thank you, er um, God Bless you Brian, our quick witted, Atheist server. The grounds were impeccable. Front desk service was professional. And our room's lil fridge was stocked to the gills. Anyone who knows me, knows I'm a huge FLW nut, and love all of his architecture and those that he inspired. You truly feel his spirit here at the Biltmore. Especially after boozing it up in the afternoon sun. As we sat in the spa today, awaiting our masseuses, we noticed front page news in the AZ Republic, announcing a $300 million Biltmore renovation. And. Well. It's a good thing. Cracked paint. Buckled ceilings and dated furniture. Though badly needed. Did not mar the ambiance, energy and joy we experienced for our retreat. Standing in line for our $6 bagel and $8 smoothie, we overheard the church goers behind us actually praying for lower prices. Wow. Does that work? Jab number three. I didn't stick around to find out.

The room was spacious enough, clean, had a nice patio overlooking the pool and a two sink bathroom which I appreciated. This property is very spread out so depending on where you are staying and where your meeting is (assuming you are there on business), you may have a bit of a hike ahead of you.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Nice, but not on my top ten list of finer resorts in the Phoenix area.  This hotel is quickly becoming very dated.  The rooms are not at all modern.  They are quite the contrary; old, including the room furniture and room decor.  While this may have been stylish location 15+ years ago, time has passed the Biltmore by.  

Our room was large, but it was also dark; not enough lamps in the room to provide more lighting.  The closet ceiling light operated with a pull chain, which if you're shorter than 5'5"" tall, good luck reaching it.  The bed was extremely soft and saggy, and the pillows were like bricks.  Carpeting could have used some cleaning as well.  In addition, our room do not have a full length mirror.   Even a room at a Fairfield Inn comes with a full length mirror.

While the grounds are quite wonderful, beware of the scorpions.  We had such a visitor in our room one afternoon.  Thankful we saw him as he saw us. 

Food and drinks are grossly overpriced, so I would recommend dining off this location.  

If you require Wi-Fi srrvice, their complimentary service is more miss, than hit.  However, their pay for Wi-Fi works just fine.  Just another overpriced service and fee they can nail you into paying if you require Internet access.

A few months ago I attended a seminar at the Biltmore. About an hour into it, I leaned over to a friend sitting next to me and whispered that the conference room we were in was ""really cool"". Not sure why, not sure how, but somehow my diminished-capacity brain for architecture detected something, I guess, extraordinarily ""pretty"". Some time later, and I swear this is true and I'm not making it up, another equally diminished-capacity friend (we're all lawyers, 'nuff said) sitting on my other side leaned over to tell me, ""Hey, this room is pretty amazing isn't it?"" He hadn't heard me say anything to my other friend. The room was so amazing that even two architecture morons' dog-like instincts for pretty buildings were setting off alarm bells in their thick skulls, completely independent of each other. 

Only after we finished the seminar did we learn that the conference room was, of course, designed by the late, great Frank Lloyd Wright circa 1929. I am unable to explain the intangible details of why it was so incredible, other than to say that while sitting inside it, everything felt perfectly balanced, perfectly in tune, and perfectly pretty.

I've been to the Biltmore on other occasions, to meet friends at the bar for a drink, and to have tea with guests who were staying there.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"My husband had a customer to attend to in Phoenix, and it just worked out that my daughter and I could tag along for the weekend to enjoy the sun.  We used to live in Phoenix, and in the area of the Biltmore, so it was very special to be ""home"" for a few days and visit our old haunts and friends.  We have seen the Biltmore during the tough times of the recession, and so was VERY happy to see the area going strong!   Even the community around the Biltmore is thriving- new building, refurbishments, etc... it was absolutely fantastic to see.
We were in the Terrace building in a suite, so we had a separate King bedroom with a living room.  Our daughter stayed on the pull out couch and was quite happy.  We had two patios, one with a 4 seat dining table and one with four lounger chairs- perfect views of the court yard (check out my photos).  The room was beautifully upgraded in tones of Gray/Greens that were super soothing.  The bed was out of this world comfortable (I was counting sheets so I can re-build this at home..lol);  great master bath with a soaker tub and big shower, double sinks and a makeup counter/mirror.   We had a second  1/2 bath that made it so nice traveling with a teenager      Katie and Cherish- personal concierge's at the hotel took AMAZING care of us.  Make sure you introduce yourself!
We were given access to the Ocatilla exec lounge as I am a Diamond Honors member and am very impressed by the offering.  We had breakfast there several times (continental), and iced tea and cold water/snacks are available thru-out the day.  They do offer snacks in the early evening but we were SO busy, we didn't quite make it back for that;  however, we did enjoy wine/happy hour past 8 pm each evening which we loved.  There is a separate fire pit off the patio, so you can enjoy the cool AZ nites with your wine   They brought in the most amazing desserts at this time as well- again, see my photos.
My daughter and I visited two of the pools on different days;  if you want quiet comfort- then go for the Ocatilla pool;  if you want great current music, dancing, and food/drink services, hit up the main pool- very lively.  My daughter is 13 and she loved BOTH experiences.  You just cannot beat the Arizona sun in February.   We had a turkey wrap and drinks and arrived in about five mins time.  Great service for a busy pool day.
My husband and I did ""full"" breakfast at Frank and Albert's one morning;  and Adobe grill another.  We have great memories at both of these locations and simply could not resist a visit.  Frank and Albert's has been expanded it appears and the ambiance is wonderful.  Fireplaces and firepits scattered around to keep you warm, and the service was friendly and efficient.   Adobe grill holds a special place in our memories as we visited almost every Saturday when we lived in Arizona-  the menu and the restaurant has been VERY nicely redone and you cannot improve these views.  Food was wonderful- try the Big AZ Burrito with chorizo.  Fantastic.
Your evenings absolutely have to be spent outdoors around the courtyard 'somewhere'... whether that's on the Ocatilla patio, or by the main building fire pits- it's the perfect Arizona evening.  Grab a glass of wine from the bar and sit under those stars.
Also, if you want a local spot to visit (where only the locals go) check out Rokerij on 16th street and order the Chicken Chimayo-  you won't be disappointed.

#1 we stayed in the ""A"" cottages, and our mini fridge had a bad seal and was leaking.  We informed the concierge and they sent maintenance. We had a note saying it is was fixed, but not so much, the seal was still bad and it still leaked. 
#2, the seal under the front door was a little wide so we would wake every morning to an infestation of pill bugs that continued throughout the day. The Sunday morning we were to check out I was greeted by a large cockroach standing between me and the bathroom. Once it ran under the vanity I turned on all the lights and kept a diligent watch for it.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Sometimes a place, an event, a meeting of soul and spirit happens that is to be one of those life events in a place that will change you forever. I was invited to attend a High Tea at the Tea Court at the Arizona Biltmore, which I had no way of knowing was to be one of those life changing events.

Oh, I've been to High Tea before, but never one that provided an experience that was so intense, yet so relaxing that the world passed us by and we were totally unaware of more than the Tea Sommelier and his depth of knowledge of the Teas, the Delectables and the Pastries we were served.

The Tea Court sits just across from the main lobby in the Arizona Biltmore. It is in its own alcove with an invisible veil that you feel immediately upon entering the space. The hustle & bustle of weddings, tourists, hotel guests and staff are so close, yet the veil is somehow protecting the Tea Court from the constant activity. The peace of the Tea Sommelier's words and the calm heart you feel knowing you are where you were meant to be at this very moment in your life.

The Tea Sommelier, Kevin Michael Doyle, was where he was born to be. He has found his rightful place in this world and he knows it. He feels it and anyone who listens to his words knows that he is an expert and that he truly loves this very moment in time.

We experienced Black Currant Tea, African Solstice herbal infusion, Ginger and Pear White Tea. The Delectables included Smoked Salmon, Creme Fraiche, Cucumber, Sweet Red Onion, and Capers on Pumpernickel; Dill and Shrimp Salad Cherry Tomatoes; Lobster Basil Salad in Profiterole Crisp and many more . . . plus the Pastry selections included a Schnepf Farms Peach Mousse Swan, a handmade Turtle Truffle, White & Dark chocolate swirl strawberries, and many more . . . the elegance of the Tea Court touched that spirit that lies hidden within us all.

I can think of no place I would have rather spent an entrancing Saturday afternoon that with a small alumni group and Dean Gangone than at the Biltmore Tea Court with Kevin Michael Doyle.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Flawless check-in: Front desk staff greeted me promptly, told me my room was ready and I was given vouchers for breakfast, welcome letters from the manager, and directions with a little map on how to navigate the grounds.  I had also forgotten my phone charger at home, so I got directions to the closest Verizon store (but not before the concierge checked to see if he had an extra charger in the stash of chargers people left behind in their hotel rooms).

The common courtyard/garden is spectacular- there are tables & chairs that surround one side, fire pits at night, adirondack chairs on the edges, all overlooking a showcase water fountain, grass, palm trees & flowers.  Great landscaping!  There are also little nooks between hotel & villa/cottage buildings- I stumbled across a giant lawn chess set as I was trying to get to the parking lot one day- very cool.  Room service rides around the property on big tricycles- very cool.  When I was here, there were lots of families and older folks- there was a golf tournament & Passover event so I'm guessing those are the drivers of the weekend demographics.

Hotel room was very standard and almost a disappointment if I didn't read it already in the other Yelp reviews.  I got a good deal too so I wasn't too bummed...just know that the rooms are a little dated and don't really match the Wright style of design that dominates the exterior and the common areas.  The A/C is also very loud- I ran it during the day while I wasn't in the room and turned it off at night so I could sleep in peace.  Bed is alright- mattress is a little too springy for me, has a cushy feather bed on top and a good amount of pillows- but Westin bed it ain't.  On my last night, there was a giant and bright full moon, which I enjoyed by opening my curtains and letting the moonlight shine into my room.  There are quite a few options in different price ranges- the cottages look fun and have patios where you can sit outside...I'm guessing those cost quite a bit more.

Huge con- parking.  Valet costs $20+ a night, and Self Parking is $12...there's definitely not enough space for self parking so you're left to stalk guests who are leaving, or suck it up and park in the valet.  It's also quite a trek if you end up parking at the far end of the lot...I didn't mind since I could use the exercise, but if you have luggage or can't walk that far, be prepared to valet or be dropped off at the front entrance.  

Another con that I ended up being happy about- their spa was completely booked for Spa Week and they couldn't possibly fit in another treatment, even for a paying guest like myself.  It ended up OK, b/c I spent the day at another resort and spa, which i liked even better.  I took a stroll though the spa area- it was attached to the main pool area which was very loud, and didn't seem as lush or pleasant as the spa I ended up going to.  The pool areas get very full- try checking out the multiple pools they have on property to see which best fits your style.  Cheap thin small pool towels too- you'll need at least 2 to cover your chair.

Really convenient- near Biltmore Fashion Park for shopping & restaurants, and not far from the highway and airport.

The place was apparently designed by Wright's protege, with his consultation and guidance.  Every US President has stayed here since it's construction along with the elite of Old Hollywood.  The bartender told me that Marilyn Monroe would stay here for three months at a time.  

As for the hotel itself, the rooms are very spacious with balconies, the grounds are immaculate, and the pool(s) are incredible.  This place has a waterslide!  Not to mention two golf courses, a put-put course, tennis courts, a full gym, spa, and fire pits outside the bar which are always crowded with people gathered around drinking, smoking cigars and the like.  My one gripe about this place is that it is difficult to get ice!  You'd think this would be very simple but the ice machines were nearly always locked in housekeeping closets.  Instead you either have to call room service for ice or trek all the way down to the bar and ask for a bucket.  Slightly annoying, but overall, what a place!

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"An idol of my youth whose best times are probably behind it, sadly.

I've been there so many times for special occasions. It's always seemed like the real core of the Valley to me. The grounds and main halls are still beautiful and are maintained with a reverence that is befitting a national landmark.

But as a place to stay . . . . ya know. . . there's a newer Hilton not so far away. And the Marriott Buttes are really nice. Out in North Scottsdale and Carefree they have some really great places, too.

Your experience of the Biltmore will depend entirely on two factors: How much you have to spend, and in which section your room resides.

The newer casita section is nice and feels modern and premium. The rooms that were built-up in the 50's and 60's are less so, but still nice in their modernist way. The rooms in the main building would seem to be the real catch, but only for those with an historical interest. The world does hotel rooms differently now than they did in the 1920's, and there are some elements of the layout that can't be changed--like needing to walk a block or so (partially through a carpeted lobby)  to get to the pool.

Also, if you happen to get a deal on the rooms at their Summertime rate (which can be a great savings) keep in mind that you'll also be paying over $12 for a plain bagel and plain coffee at the on-site Starbucks. Unlike at many other hotels, there's no way to just pop across the street to get something more reasonable. You'll likely need to drive a mile or so to get to the slightly less-expensive Biltmore Fashion Park or the businesses along Camelback Road. And it can get tiring if you decide to self-park instead of availing yourself of the valet parking (which rings in at a modest $20 per day plus gratuity), because the self-parking areas can be a real hike. 

So if you have the dosh to hang with the elite crowd--or just a really fat expense account and an understanding boss or controller--then I'm sure it can be a suitably swank experience. And you know Clark Gable and Rita Hayworth and the Reagans and all of them stayed there.

My wife and I travel often. We enjoy fine foods, great service, and class. We were very impressed with the fabulous host of the Arizona Biltmore High Tea Service when we were there for our anniversary. Kevin was absolutely wonderful, friendly, warm, gracious, and an utter professional. This kind of service can only be found at the finest restaurants. It is akin to the high level service we had at Mugaritz in San Sebastián. Kevin is a rare treat. It was an absolute surprise to have this kind of attention to detail for tea. All teas were served and paired wonderfully well. All of our inquiries into everything from the service, tea history, pairing recommendations, preferences, and such received warm explanation and conversation. It was so wonderful to meet someone who it is evident from their enthusiasm and attention cares and loves doing the job they do so well. I wish we had service by Kevin everywhere we go.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I stayed here for a week due to a work event so can't comment on the price (thanks work) but can on the atmosphere and service. 

This place is beautiful! It's a little more rustic than my usual style but still very classy. They also have little shops near the lobby which makes it truly feel like a resort since you're so closed off. The service was attentive and our room was huge and beautiful! We had a walk out balcony looking at the mountains in the backdrop which was stunning. We also rented a private cabana at the pool and was easily the best experience we had. Although they could probably use a little cleaning - I definitely had no intention on sitting on the couch inside. 

The location of our hotel room though was pretty far from everything else. I guess with how large this place is, it's hard to to accommodate everyone in terms of location. But it would have made more sense to have our very large event in at least one area - we were completely spread out and there were easily 400 of us. The restaurants were pretty good but a little overpriced. 

Not the Biltmore's fault but it was miserably hot when we were here. Arizona is not really for me, I do better in snow. I was also constantly fearful of scorpions nearby even though I never saw one. Also, you guys have some really creepy looking birds that like to attack leftover food. No thanks! I'll stick to Chicago where we just have bad drivers and cold weather.

I'm docking it in stars because of the customer service. I didn't read the charges until I returned (it was emailed after checkout) because it was a long week of working but realized I was overcharged on some things. When I called, I kept getting voicemails and to leave my information. But no one called me back for 2 days! Finally I had to pressure a guy at the front desk to answer my questions since billing wouldn't. He corrected the issue and sent me a new bill immediately but for such a nice hotel AND for such a large group that just dropped a load of money on your resort, ignoring someone for two days is not acceptable.",3,"[u' more rustic', u' very large', u' pretty good', u' miserably hot', u' nice hotel']",2.103571429,"[u' little shops', u' little cleaning', u' constantly fearful', u' really creepy', u' bad drivers', u' cold weather']",-3.075
v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Went for a 2 day work event with my family of 4 (a fun working vacation is what I imagined). 

My room had a 19"" TUBE tv... Seriously?! Do those even exist still? Especially in a resort? I haven't owned one of those since the 90's. 

The beds only had 2 pillows a piece.... Don't hotels usually come with 4 pillows per bed? That's a rhetorical question as I travel frequently and every hotel I've stayed in does... Except for this resort. 

The bathtub and shower was something out of a low rent apartment - $300 a month low rent apartment, but here I am paying $300 a night at a resort. 

Here's the kicker - there were 140 people in my group and the ones I was able to connect with all were blown away with their rooms. I was the only one traveling with my family; my colleagues were alone. They took videos and photos of their rooms cause they were so impressed. I'm looking at rooms that had HUGE flat screen tvs, living rooms with couches and arm chairs, beds with 5 pillows, one room had a bath tub so large 3 adults could fit in it. FOR ONE PERSON. Why they would put my family of 4 in literally the smallest, crappiest room they had, I have no idea... But there was a huge, discriminatory difference between the room my family of 4 were put in and my singular colleagues were put in. 

Also, my daughter forgot her iPad and iPhone chargers, and when I called to see if they could send it to us, the person I spoke to took 15 minutes to tell me they found a Samsung charger in a room that wasn't even mine. Wow, great for that customer, how about me?  I ended up just ending the call without resolution, frustrated. I would rather buy new chargers than listen to list of the stuff they found that belonged to other customers. 

I was VERY excited to come to this resort, and was VERY disappointed with the experience. Just way too bad.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"My husband and I decided to do a staycation weekend . First, the positives :
1. Our waitresses at Frank and Alberts were wonderful! Actually the entire staff is very friendly.
2. I've read others complain that the staff at the spa were not welcoming or attentive . That was not my experience. Lisa showed me around and made sure I was all set. My massage therapist was a lot of fun and did a great job.
3 The Bell/Valet staff were very friendly and helpful .
4 The room was clean and spacious. Plenty of pillows and a comfortable bed. 

The reason for three stars :

1. The food is overpriced . It was good not great. The brownie for dessert was dry. The chicken was kind of thrown on the side of the Caesar salad and just didn't taste good . The Cosmo was so strong I had to pour water into it in order to drink it. The margarita was strong , cloying sweetness to it . For the price expectations are high. We didn't bother with brunch because our so so dinners cost over $300 so we weren't in the mood to pay another $88+ for brunch .

2. The Spa: other reviewers are right about the lounge : it is exactly like a doctors office waiting room. It is way too small and coed is not my thing. I advise if you go you do so first thing in the morning . It is brightly lit and you hear the staff interacting loudly. Not their fault, it is not physically set up
to be relaxing . My attendant had issues finding my sandal size because they are crammed Willy nilly in empty lockers. Um: you're a resort. Go
to Ikea and get some organizers. My biggest issue: unsanitary conditions. The benches in the locker room where bare private parts make contact are upholstered with velour material . FYI they have stains on them : pale yellow stains . There's a similar bench near the jacuzzi where wet bottoms sit . It's gross . This furniture should be washable and washed frequently throughout the day. There are quotes from the spa manager on the web and printed materials talking about health and wellness : word to the wise, someone is going to get MRSA . The jacuzzi only has two lounge chairs and the aforementioned velour bench for seating . It is a very small area . Again , go early or prepare to be very annoyed . There are only three restroom stalls so it gets crowded . I expected more from a spa bearing names like Waldorf, Astoria and Hilton. 
I am also used to a heated, soft massage table and warm linens . Cold linens are not relaxing . 
There is history here and we appreciated that. I know I'm supposed to be wowed by the architecture but it reminds me of my community college back home . The gardens were pretty . But not gorgeous. There was a fountain with brown stagnant water. Again, you're a resort. 
The Paradise pool area has music and a cafe . It's lively and fun. The pool right down the path from there is more conducive to relaxing and has wait service available . 
We don't plan to return as there are so many other resorts in the area to explore .",3,"[u' very friendly', u' great job', u' very friendly', u' comfortable bed', u' so strong', u' brightly lit', u' warm linens', u' more conducive', u' so many']",4.908333333,"[u' not great', u' too small', u' empty lockers', u' very small', u' very annoyed', u' Cold linens', u' not gorgeous']",-2.545
v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"My husband and I purchased a package that included a night's accommodations and dinner for two at Frank & Albert's at a charity auction last year.  But just like Groupon, the voucher was about to expire so we stayed in June.  Did we get a $350 stay?  No, but it was for charity.

While the grounds are gorgeous and you cannot deny the impressive architecture, there are too many misses to for a luxury hotel.

First off, parking.  If I'm going to pay to self-park a half mile away in 110 degree heat, I might as well fork out a few extra dollars and pay the ridiculous $27/night for valet.  I understand parking fees in a city where space is at a premium, but this is Arizona.  This hotel, in particular, does not appear to be short on it.  Second, luggage handling and bell service.  We did not need these services, however, upon exiting our vehicle, it appeared the entire entrance was a chaotic mess.  Third, water.  Okay, charge me for Voss or Fiji, but you can't cough up a free bottle of your hotel branded water to guests that might be on the verge of heat exhaustion after making the trek from their car?  Even Holiday Inn Express gives me a free bottle, not to mention other Waldorf Astoria hotels I've stayed at.  Fourth,  while the restaurant prices seemed reasonable, the cafe prices were worse than any airport.  I suppose the restaurants are looking to draw in locals, but the cafe is only used by guests.  

As for the rooms, ours was spacious and the bathroom had been remodeled relatively recently.  But it was odd that certain fixtures (faucets and towel racks) had been replaced, but others were not (bathroom tissue holder).  The rest of the room, however, was in dire need of an update.  The furnishings were tired and worn.  The bed was comfy, however.  I was also disappointed that the balcony wall was so high you could not see the gardens below from the room at all or from the balcony itself unless you were standing.

While I would possibly stay again, in a different building, I'm not sure.  I got the impression this is a party hotel of sorts.  We encountered more than one group of drunken guests that fell into this category.

things did not start well and just got worse as they went. first, they couldn't find my reservation. i was part of a group how could they not find it. after almost 30 mins of searching they finally found it. they then told me i would have to switch rooms the next day. i was ok with it untill i saw the room the next day. it was smaller and it had a view of some roof. i asked why i had to change rooms and they said it was because they were sold out. i told them i shouldn't have had to change and they didn't care.

next was my laundry. they have a laundry service which is nice but way over priced. they took my clothes at 12:30 on a friday. i was promised they would be back by 1:00 the next day. 3 o'clock came and they still hadn't returned. at 4 i had to go buy a new set of dress clothes because they still hadn't returned. i did not get my clothes back untill 10pm. which was completely unacceptable.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Ok, let's start with what this hotel IS NOT:

It was officially NOT designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The architect of record is Albert McArthur, though he sought advice from FLW on the ""block system"" that was stylishly used on the place to great effect. 

But...there are obvious FLW influences throughout the property (especially in the main building lobby), and  (because FLW was a true ****) he said in public that this is McArthur's design while privately trying to take credit. That being said, I am an FLW fan and was lucky enough to spend a lot of time in one of his Paradise Valley homes...and this place has just enough ""vibe"" to it to make anyone seeking the FLW feel be happy. Ok, I digress...

If you are looking for a sparkly clean, no cracks, built in 2012, all amenities resort...don't come here. This property is old school charm and elegance to the max. The thing it doesn't (and shouldn't) have is that extra ""something"" preferred by 30-ish middle America d-bags that only comes with a hip spa that paints ""your lady's"" toenails with American flags. Gross. 

This property is for anyone who appreciates old school luxury. The main building's ""classic rooms"" are throwbacks. They aren't huge, the windows aren't perfectly sealed, you can hear a bit of your posh neighbors' conversations...but in this setting, wouldn't you want to?

The grounds are stunning and gorgeous and the staff was impeccable. 

I checked in and, after being asked twice if I was there for a special occasion, was given a free upgrade (to my already discounted December rate) to a suite overlooking the hills with a near private swimming pool. Problem was: it was TOO BIG for the two of us and we didn't want to be by the lovely tennis courts...we wanted the action. So they seamlessly transitioned us into one of the much smaller main building rooms. Bliss. 

Within an hour of checking in to our new room, a knock came...behind the knock was a man delivering a bottle of sparkling wine, two flutes and a plate of six huge chocolate covered strawberries. Also on the tray was a note from the front desk guy (Frankie - you rock!) congratulating us on our celebration and expressing his hope that we liked the new room. Come on, that's a class move. 

Anyway, we immediately went downstairs, ordered a Monte Carlo and a perfect Manhattan, sat by the fire pit and watched the sun go down behind the gorgeous Camelback Mountain - all the time feeling more and more like Spencer Tracey and Katherine Hepburn than a regular LA couple out to visit the 'rents.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"My stay started off very well. The front desk was very helpful. My room was not ready so she upgraded me to a much larger and nicer room. The problem is that the room probably is considered to be in another county. It was quite a walk. We went in Frank and Alberts for lunch. This was an odd experience. Four of us had meals with very small portions, and the other two meals were way too big of portions. The grilled cheese is an embarrassment to food, period. It is also a bit pricey for what you get. 

The room is nice but slightly dated. It had a 90's feel to it. This is OK in most hotels, but in a place like the Biltmore you can not let your rooms get that far behind. My room was huge. I had a full kitchen and living room area. 

There are several pools through out the property. The pool by my room was great because it was in a low traffic area. I was able to swim in peace any time of day. 

Parking can be a pain. I would recommend using the valet, but if your room is where mine was you have to walk over a 1/4 mile to get to the valet. 

There were some renovation taking place, so hopefully that will update the overall look of the rooms. The area as a whole is nice. There are some very good views.",3,"[u' full kitchen', u' very good']",1.26,"[u' not ready', u' very small']",-0.425

A quick call to the front desk, and we were promptly moved to the building near the pool and all the other guests. From then on, everything was fantastic. Our rooms (we had two) were both very nice. Dinner at Wrights was out of this world. Service was outstanding. The wedding reception was held at the hotel, and the staff and the food were great.

Let me tell you...things have gone downhill. I took my husband and son today because they had never been and my son's girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. The tea service was abysmal. Kevin Doyle, the tea sommelier was still there and entertaining as always, and we tried several types of Tea Forte but the food offerings were, for the most part, bite-sized at best. What used to be larger than small, tea sandwiches were less than an inch in size. The bread was hard and dry. No salmon mouse, no caviar. The scone and pound cake were good served with preserves and there was also a bite-sized cinnamon roll which was divine. The  Devonshire Cream and Lemon curd were good but rather thick and dry and the desserts were awful (mostly cookie types). Everything was about sugar and flour. The desserts we used to get were very large and varied...mousse, chocolates, cakes, etc. These desserts weren't any better than you could find in a grocery store and some not even as good as that. And this place is NOT cheap. It's $42 a person plus an 18% gratuity on the whole bill.

In the past when my ladies used to go, if you left hungry it was your own fault. We were constantly asked, ""Would you like more,"" and everything was so good, we said ""yes"" always. They would even send us home with more of their incredible foods. 

Today, we got one of everything and that was it. No asking us if we wanted more. Granted we got all the tea we could drink and it was excellent...my favorite was the Swiss Apple and I came home and promptly ordered a canister for myself and one for my son and his girlfriend.

the biltmore looks like a phoenix hotel should, if that makes any sense
it seems like an older hotel with more or less recent-y upgrades
the room was pretty clean - the bed cushy and comfortable
the bathroom was okay, they had gilchrist & soames shampoo, conditioner, body wash and lotion. i was not a fan of the shower - it had one of those rain shower heads and while it was a little better than being spit upon, it wasn't that much better - i.e., the water pressure sucked. so was the draining - i was getting ankle-deep because of the slow drainage - yuck! i don't take very long showers, but i had to turn it off twice just to let it drain.
the tv is nice - they had the standard channels (hbo, espn, cnn, tbs, tnt, etc), although no food channel, booo. they also had a video controller, so i guess you would be able to play some video games, but i don't
they have one of those ipod docking station alarm clocks, so that was also nice, except i forgot my ipod
my room connected to the rooms on each side (that would be the older hotel part, i guess). the doors to those rooms had full-length mirrors on them, but the placement of the lounging chairs made it hard to get full use out of the full-length mirrors.
the hotel is not near anything else and definitely not walkable to anything but the multitude of pools, tennis courts and golf course, not that you would want to walk anywhere most of the time in phoenix - it was over 100 degrees the whole time i was there (in Sept), so we ate at one of the hotel restaurants - frank & albert's. small plates for dinner and breakfasts. the pulled pork empanadas were okay - it wasn't very warm, i expected it to be warm and it was sitting on a cold bed of corn, beans and avocado. the chicken lollipops, while messier, were much better. had the same issue as the empanadas with the dessert, as the cookie crumbles - i think the description was ""made to order"" so i figured that meant that the cookie would be warm, it was not - there was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it, but i had a bite as soon as they put the plate down and even the part that wasn't touching the ice cream was cool",3,"[u' top floor', u' also nice', u' full use', u' very warm']",2.23,"[u' small plates', u' cold bed']",-0.85

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"SUMMARY:  biggest problem at this hotel is no thermostats in the room.  Read on...

First, this historic hotel has 3 different Yelp listings, all with their own set of reviews.  Not sure why that is, but make sure you read all of them.  Yelp really should consolidate them, but for now, make sure you go to the other Arizona Biltmore listings on Yelp and check out the reviews there too....

I've spent many Christmas Eve's on the Biltmore's patio because I have family that lives just a mile away and we love the atmo.  This year I decided to splurge and rent a room at Christmas.  Everything you read about the ""fallen on hard times"" aspect of the guest rooms is true.  It's obvious that Hilton (aka Waldorf Astoria) has decided to not sink any more money into this property for upkeep and they're relying on the majesty of the architecture and main lobby etc. to pull them through.  The result is generally disappointing but then they're offering pretty good deals for rooms (and you can understand why since the guest rooms are somewhat run down or falling apart).

The reason we loved our stay: the pet policy.  You can bring Fido and Fifi with you on your vacation.  That was the big upside.

The downside:

1)  NO THERMOSTATS IN THE FREAKING ROOM!  Ok, Waldorf Astoria WTF?  It's cold in Arizona in the winter.  We needed to use the heater.  Guess what?  It doesn't turn off on its own once it reaches a certain/any temperature.  It just keeps on blowing.  So you have to get out of bed multiple times during the night to continuously turn on/off the mother-bleeping heater.  After it gets too hot, jump out of bed to turn it off, then an hour later, it's cold again and you have to jump out of bed again to turn it back on.  NO - it wasn't broken.  We had engineering to our room twice.  Each time the guys just shrugged and explained that there was no thermostat.  Considering that thermostats cost all of $30, it's a travesty that GM of this hotel hasn't ordered thermostats for the guest rooms.

2)  Clueless, absolutely clueless front desk personnel.  The front desk personnel are mostly under 30 and maybe even under 25.   Let's just say that you get what you pay for.  They don't know about their own property, give out lots of wrong information and don't know themselves that there are NO THERMOSTATS IN THE GUEST ROOMS!  If they knew, they wouldn't have to send engineering over to tell us.  Our final bill was wrong and I had to explain to the person that checked us out how the debit/credit columns worked on the receipt I was given, explaining that we weren't credited for something we'd already paid for.  They also didn't know how the bike rentals worked.

3)  Severely understaffed.  We had to call the front desk (or ""0"") many times during our stay and there were times when the phone rang over 5 minutes before ANYONE picked up, even the operator.

4)  Noisy spa.  Forget about that ""renewal"" and ""rejuvenation"" that the pretty brochure promises.  I went to the spa 3 times and each time there were annoying chattering women dittering away about nonsense, their voices echoing against the tile, each freaking time.  Some of those times it was spa personnel speaking in their loud ""stage"" voice.  Unbelievable.  Imagine trying to relax when that dittering female chatter is in Hebrew (probably the ugliest language on the planet next to German) and understand that it is no place to go if you want some peace and quiet -- no one enforces the ""quiet"" zones and there are no signs or verbal prompts to please keep quiet from staff.

5)  Dirty premises.  We saw a room service tray lying on the ground for two whole days outside the door of the room next to us and no one came to pick it up.  We walked by it each time we went in/out of our room.  Another time we waited all day for our room to be serviced and no one came, even 4 hours after we put in a request for it.

Our stay wasn't a total disaster, but want to realistically explain to wide-eyed potential guests that, as romantic as the premises are, the hotel is not being well managed and it is sorely in need of some repair and upgrades, and possibly a whole lot of re-training of personnel too.

We'll still probably come back, but only if they get some freaking $30 thermostats installed into the guest rooms.  3 Stars are for Frank Lloyd Wright's vision and subtract two stars for some shoddy management.",3,"[u' own set', u' pretty good', u' own once', u' too hot', u' absolutely clueless', u' own property', u' many times', u' pretty brochure']",3.475,"[u' Not sure', u' hard times', u' generally disappointing', u' wrong information', u' shoddy management']",-1.941666667

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I've stayed at the Biltmore twice, once was a five star experience, and the other was about a three, so I'll split the difference and give them a four. 

The first time I stayed here was in a super cute cottage. We had fabulous service from everyone. The only complaint I had with this trip was that housekeeping knocked at 9 AM (which they did on my second trip too). I realize nine is not ungodly, but it's a little early to be hustled out of your room so someone can make your bed, that you would have never left if you didn't have to stop the persistent knocking from the other side of the door. So that sucked. But besides that it was a great experience.

This last time was okay. We got a great deal on the room and they let us check in super early, which was awesome. The air wasn't working when we first got to the room, but I'll let them off the hook for that because they quickly fixed it and the room was cool before the 4:00 check-in time, so for all I know that was their plan the whole time. My boyfriend spent the morning golfing and even though it was miserably hot,  had a great time. The bartenders at the pool were nice enough, and we were pretty obnoxious, so nice enough is pretty much all we could hope for.

One of the sinks in the bathroom didn't drain and the cosmetic mirror in the bathroom was broken (not the mirror the little thing that kept it stable in the wall), so that was a minor inconvenience that I wouldn't normally expect from resorts of this caliber.

We also got a couple in room massages, which were great, but then due to a misunderstanding with the credit cards on file (I used mine for the room, my boyfriend used his for the massages), I got charged for both the room AND the massages. And, god bless my boyfriend, but I really can't rationalize spending $400 on a couple 55 minute backrubs unless that back rub comes with, say, an iPod. I called Biltmore and they said they could reverse the charges and put them on another card, but it might be easier to just ask him for the cash. So he paid me back but I obviously wish I could have avoided it all together. I mean, that's awkward right? To have someone do a nice gesture for you and then you end up accidentally paying for the nice gesture so you have to awkwardly bring up that while the gesture was nice, you kind of can't pay for it and omg I already feel like I'm on an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm so I'll just stop right there and hope you get the point. It was very stressful for me.

Assuming you don't share my social etiquette neurosis, I'm sure you'll have a great  time at the Biltmore. The summer rates are unbeatable, and if you can stay at a Cottage do so because they are just adorable, especially by the little putt putt holes. Just make sure to double check your room upon check in and double check your folio upon check out and you'll be fine.",4,"[u' super cute', u' fabulous service', u' great experience', u' great deal', u' miserably hot', u' great time', u' pretty obnoxious', u' pretty much', u' nice gesture', u' nice gesture', u' great time', u' just adorable']",6.441666667,"[u' only complaint', u' little thing']",-0.3375

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I stayed at this hotel on June 3 to June 5.  While the architecture, and the fact that it is tightly linked with the genius that is Frank Lloyd Wright, is worth at least a night's stay, the overall experience is somewhat confusing and a mish-mash forcing one to ponder whether one has experienced an elite bastion of resort history or a dying emblem of what might have been. 

I stayed at the Ocatilla -- the ""hotel within a hotel.""  The room was well-appointed and delightfully lush compared with my friends' off-the-rack accommodations which appeared somewhat worn and needing refurbishment.  

As part of the Ocatilla, one is promised amenities such as a shoe-shine and pressing service.  None of which was ever offered, nor seemed realistically obtainable.  

The Ocatilla executive club room was tightly guarded. Indeed, when my room key would not open the club room door, I was asked for my name and room number and I was somewhat humbled that I just might have entered under dubious circumstances.  The offerings for breakfast were carbohydrates only, with an exception for yogurt in a martini glass.  And I did see at least two gusts bring in their own cereal. 

The swimming pool near my room, one of several on the property, was delightful.  As I'm not much for Phoenix sunlight, we reveled in the salt water pool at night.  With few people present, it was a great deal of fun and was by far the most fun I've had in a while. 

The spa was not so delightful.  The men's locker room was eery, with lockers being close to the door.  To walk into such a small area with retiree genitalia flailing may be entertaining to some, but can be somewhat disturbing for those with higher expectations.  The attendants that were on staff ranged from over-reaching (acceptable) to a too-young apprentice who I overheard talking with a loud-mouthed receptionist about the horrors of toilet paper remnants lodged in women's pubic hair.  While anyone able to afford the high prices should be strong, who among us should be that strong? 

The spa's manicurist was terrific.  I just wished there would have been a more private area in which to have my hooves trimmed.  Passersby were gawking through the windows and it reminded me of a cheap Asian nail establishment in the Indianapolis mall. 

My overall experience memory stems from my initial check-in experience.  The Waldorf sent an E-mail after I had made my reservation that said that, if available, when I checked in I could spend an additional  $20 to be upgraded.  When I mentioned this to the desk clerk she had no idea what I wa talking about and said: ""Well, you already have an Ocatilla executive room.""  Though I was silent, my reply should have been: ""Honey, if you told me I could have something a little better for twenty bucks, then make it happen.""  Oversold.  Under-delivered. 

That I was with friends a week after my mother's death was cool.  But the physical experience was lacking.  My opinion only, but I think this property was built for a timeless level of service that time and numbed expectations will deny her.",2,"[u' own cereal', u' great deal', u' so delightful']",2.4,"[u' somewhat confusing', u' small area']",-0.55

Frank & Alberts ""High Five"" Happy Hour. 
Wait, you're not shocked right? There's major food and booze involved in my review. 

Yes, yes. There's the pool And I'll DEFINITELY GET TO THAT. 

The bathrooms have wonderful showers and the beds are like heaven sighed. Even if you stay near an elevator you'll never hear it. Room service is impeccable. (And they will go out of their way to deliver something special for birthdays.) The main lobby area is a special place to come for a fancy evening cocktail. You can come casual or dressed to the nines. 

So...right. Happy Hour. 'Cause I like to drink and eat. 

Uh...tucked right into the cutest bar you'll find a hub bub of activity come happy hour. Guest flock here. Locals flock here. 

Five bucks buys you a CORNUCOPIA of blessings.
- Glass of house red or white wine
- Four ""bar bites"" (really delish restaurant food)
- Domestic beers
- Some fruity cocktails (honestly you'd have to pull the menu for that. All I hear is mwah mwah mwah :)

NO JOKE!

Who is this? My favorite Concierge. 
YOU CAN HAVE ONE? Yep. I'm sure they're all wonderful. This one has a sense of humor. And carries a supply of bandaids.

Ok. So the pool area. Bring a floppy hat 'cause you're never going to leave. 

Eh. I suppose that could be the review. But then I wouldn't be fair to explain how much FUN this place can be. 

Check it. They will pull in DJs to rock out tunes. On Sundays in July and August the music is full on party mode. AND there are Happy Hour prices at the bar. 

(Just be sure to (a) ask for the happy hour pricing menu and (b) remind the bartender to give you the pricing each time you place an order. So as an example, draft beer is $3. But ask for it! Otherwise it will cost you eight bucks.)

Although I've been told there is an ""adult"" pool. I'm not entirely sure where that is. All three pools in the Paradise Pool area were sprinkled with adults, families, kids ... and everyone seemed a-ok with the wild amount of booze. Hey, works for me!

Smart one.

Luckily, the parents chose a fancy-smancy hotel for us to stay at for our long weekend away: The Arizona Biltmore. It's a gorgeous hotel in the middle of Phoenix whose claim to fame is that every US President since its opening in the 1920s has, at one point in time, stayed at the Biltmore. The hotel spans a huge area with 8 pools scattered across its grounds, the largest of which is right next to the lobby. 

I was prepared to spend my weekend lying by the pool and studying for my exams. Instead, I discover my room is in the furthest corner of the Biltmore complex and I'd have to walk through 103 degree weather to get to the pool. I make the trek anyway (the thought of pina coladas and mojitos spur me forward), only to find out the pool is filled with little kids. I finally find an empty chair below a beach umbrella, plop myself down and order my drink from the waitress (while the little twins sitting in the chair next to me start dripping over my books). The drink arrives and...I can't taste a drop of rum in my mojito.

...There goes my perfect weekend.

Other than my disappointment by the pool, the rooms were nice and, most importantly, the A/C worked. Plus, at night when the temperature cooled down a bit, it was nice to walk around the Biltmore and admire the architecture.

The valet service was not in front of the conference center but rather in front of the hotel. After the event ended, I started to walk to the area where the parking valets were located. IT WAS PITCH BLACK WITH NO LIGHTS MARKING THE WALKWAY. Due to the lack of light, I was totally unable to see the curb and fell soundly onto the concrete walkway. I fell onto my left hip and left hand. I also struck the left side of my head on the concrete and the inside part of my left ankle.

There were random comments made about the lights and that they should have been on...that did not alter the fact that there were not! I had given them my card to retrieve my car which was brought up to the front...on the far side of the driveway. After about 5 minutes, it was brought to the curb where I was standing and I painfully got into my car. At this point a person who identified himself as head of security came to my car door and asked me what happened. I explained the foregoing to him and now noted that lights had been turned on lighting the walkway; THIS WAS MORE THAN TEN MINUTES LATER. He kept asking me exactly where I fell and I explained this to him several times. I was in severe pain with my head pounding and my ears ringing. After about 5-10 minutes of his asking how the accident occurred, he gave me a form to fill out detailing the incident with my personal information, including my phone number.

They do, however, appear to be refurbishing some of the accommodations. Except for one snooty front desk clerk at check in, virtually every staff member we met was as friendly, courteous and helpful as they could be. And we met a lot of them over our three night stay where we never left the property in search of a relaxing R&R. 
Things got off to a rather rough start when we were shoehorned into one of the smallest rooms on the property. Supposedly ""upgraded"" to the newly refurbished Paradise Wing with a ""balcony and pool view"", due to our having achieved the highest level of the Hilton chain customer loyalty program, this ""upgrade"" was anything but. The three foot wide balcony was shared lengthwise with several other rooms, requiring us to close the curtains for privacy. The pool view was there if you leaned way over the balcony and looked far, far to your right where you could see something that looked like water. The W/C was very interesting with a toilet barely at the 14 inch minimum height off of the floor, if it was indeed that tall. We literally had to ""visit"" restrooms in other public areas of the property. On the positive side, we only had to call maintenance (very nice maintenance man) once to fix the slow drainage in our sinks.
We spent two very enjoyable days lounging by the pool, utilizing one of their cabanas. We highly recommend this practice. Though a bit pricey, it's worth it. When not in the pool or sunning nearby we could keep up with the basketball games on the HD TV in the cabana. Plus, each cabana has their own restroom (see issue above). The poolside staff was just as nice and accommodating as they could possibly be.
We spent some time at the bar prior to dining each night and even ate at the bar one night. Again, outstanding service.
In case you are wondering, when we complained directly to the General Manager of the hotel (she did not bother to respond directly) the first afternoon, the next day a very nice representative offered to move us to another room (the property had plenty of nice rooms available for upgrades). As we had already unpacked and had decided we were going to be by the pool most of the stay anyway, we elected not to move. They instead waived the fee for the cabana for one of the days.

It took a good twenty minutes to find a family who was leaving to get three empty chairs. And it's not like there were actually people there-- it was not busy at all, but we realized that people just wake up early, throw their towels on chairs to save them, then come back whenever they feel like it. Luckily, the staff eventually noticed this and went around collecting the towels to free up some chairs.

We got some drinks and appetizers at the poolside bar. The service was not great; there was one woman working the bar and about 7 or 8 people just waiting around for her to take their order. Our three drinks and chips/salsa took at least 20 minutes to get. Even after she gave our drinks, it took her another 10 minutes to run our credit card and give us the tab.

=========================================
Perspective from a very frequent business traveler who is also a member of the highest tier in this hotel chain's frequent stay program.

GOOD:
The grounds are nicely manicured and the original Frank Lloyd Wright buildings are iconic. Service at The Biltmore Grill is good. Upgraded king room is spacious.

BAD:
The pathetic service starts upon arrival. The Valet/Bell Desk will not offer to help with your luggage. The Front Desk will give you keys that don't work, causing you to return to get keys that do.

Some of the rooms hearken back to an era that occasions less nostalgia: the late 80s/early 90s, which is when i think my room was last renovated.

But the thing that causes me to post this is that THE INTERNET ACCESS IN THE ROOMS IS INCREDIBLY UNRELIABLE.  I haven't had such a bad connection since the early days of dial-up.  I've been at this hotel for three days for business and my internet access has crashed on me at least three times every day, twice nearly blowing a deadline as I've been unable to send a document to my home office.  The front desk was no help at all: first they dropped me while supposedly transfering me to tech support, and then simply didn't answer the phone (it rang over 50 times, which simply shouldn't happen at a front desk).

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"The Biltmore is an incredible resort and even nicer than many other properties I have seen in my 7 years of travel experience through the Caribbean, Mexico and even Hawaii.  This resort is large, with beautiful impressive landscaping, fabulous Frank Lloyd Wright architecture, multiple pools, and an amazing golf course.  

I opted for the Octallia rooms, which are in a newer section with upgraded in room amenities along with access to the Concierge area where you can get free drinks, snacks, breakfast and access to someone to assist with dinner reservations, business center, etc.

Our room was spacious and luxurious.  I realllllly liked our room. I am big into having a comfortable place to sleep, cuddle with my honey and nap when the weather turns sour. I don't understand people who don't like nice rooms, b/c you really do spend a lot of time in there.  I looooved the bathroom which had a deep oversized tub (my fave) and I appreciated the small touches like the sea salt and nice bath products.  

The pools are busy if you choose one of the two main pool options, but the staff around them was easily accessible, friendly and honest.  We had no issues and the day we rented the cabana at the pool ($150 for partial sun/$200 for all day sun) we received outstanding service.  The cabana had a nice little room, TV and it's own bathroom along with an outdoor table and two lounge chairs.  If you prefer to have a pool to yourself, the Octallia area is deserted as well as a couple of other smaller pools but they ALSO do not have poolside service.  Chairs by the pools are first come, first serve and on the weekends, it did appear to be difficult to score a good chair so get down there early.

This resort is also incredibly family friendly.  We were there at the tail-end of spring break which was obvious as there were tons of families in the pool and running around the property.  This didn't bother us at all but I was a little surprised.  The main pool did offer a slide but it wasn't operating.  Anyway - the point is, a great luxury family friendly option for those with kiddos!

The spa was incredible.  We got 80 minute Dream Maker massages and it was AWESOME (but expensive).  I felt pampered and relaxed after.  Well worth it but oh so pricey.

The reason I am not going to give this place 5 stars is b/c everything is CRAZY expensive.  I mean, everything is literally double what it would be anywhere else and room service carried a $4 delivery charge along with a 23% surcharge tax on top of the already crazy 14% ""tourism"" tax which we paid at every hotel in the city. . RIDICULOUS.

So please keep in mind, everything is on the pricier side. This is not a ""budget"" friendly place.   But it is a luxury resort in a fabulous location with beautiful areas to dine outdoors and enjoy a drink with the ones you love.

My hotel room was in the main building - it seemed clean, but it didn't really have a great view. If you're outside of the main building, I'm sure you can get better views and rooms, but I know that some of my coworkers who upgraded out of the main area were complaining about the scorpions that had made it into their rooms.

The staff at the hotel was super nice - I have a chocolate allergy and they went out of their way to find a dessert I could eat with the provided meals.

When I got to my second floor room, because I was wearing dress shoes I didn't immediately realize that the carpet in my room had just been shampooed.  The good news (I guess) is that my carpet is clean.  The bad news is that I can't walk in my room without getting my shoes, socks or feet wet.  I finally realized that my shoes were wet when I took a serious slip on the polished bathroom floor tile - wow!  I took off my shoes thinking that the soles were just too smooth for the tile, but then my socks got immediately soaked!  That's when I figured out my carpet was just shampooed.  I called down to the desk and she offered to connect me with housekeeping ""to see if there is anything they can do.""  Here's what I expected from the front desk: can we relocate you to a room with dry carpet? I had higher customer service expectations from the front desk at the Biltmore.  I grabbed dinner and a couple of beers at the lounge and it was okay - nothing special with pretty good service.  The mosquitoes were eating me alive, and I saw several people move inside as a result.  That's really not the Biltmore's fault, though.  Nothing they can do about that, I think.

The design is wonderful, from the overall planning down to the smallest details - anyone who appreciates good architecture should stay here at least once in their life.

The services at this resort were also excellent, and I thought were very reasonably priced. I was happily surprised that it was so child-friendly, as this did not seem to be emphasized on their website. They have a great little water slide, plenty of organized kids activities, and even movies at the main pool on weekends. There's also a kids room, with sporting equipment, games, and the like. My kids had a blast, and begged to stay longer!

The adult services are also excellent, with adult classes every day, organized activities, and a very nice spa. They even bring you a nice glass of sweet tea after a workout. Of course you pay for classes, massages, and the like, but the spa is fee. And everything can by paid by room number, which is of course convenient when ordering a beer in the pool.

The only downside is that the restaurants on site are quite expensive, given the quality of the food. We didn't eat in the fanciest one, which looked like you actually needed to get dressed up for, both the others spots, including the cafe, were really overpriced. The one meal that I wished we'd had was the Sunday brunch - it looked amazing.

Anyway, we stayed in the north-most building, which was a bid secluded from the center of activity, and had it's own nice little pool and hot tub.

We are all three fans of Frank Lloyd Wright and, though he is not the architect for the buildings, and there have been several extensions, the architectural style is heavily influenced by his teachings and what remains of the original buildings has such history!  
One of my daughters expressed interest to Stephanie (at the front desk) seeing the original structures (as opposed to the more recent additions such as the one we were staying in).  She went out of her way to arrange a tour of the historic buildings and then went above and beyond by sending a gift bag to my daughter containing a Frank Lloyd Wright book!

Vouchers: We had AMEX credit for use in the restaurants and gift shop so we splurged for fine dining.  The fine print says to present them at the time of use, which we didn't see at the time of use.

This seriously concerns me now that it has happened twice because if someone were to book this for you as a gift and you didn't know it was all-inclusive you might miss out on the vouchers.  When I asked about it, they were very apologetic and told us the vouchers weren't prepared and they would deliver to our room, which they did about 10-15 minutes later.

We were the first guests to enjoy the room and I took pictures of just about everything and was blown away by the quality of the renovation. The rooms are gorgeous, the beds are deliciously comfortable, they have power outlets all over, a Keurig coffee machine, Salvatore Ferragamo bath products, storage space for days, a huge closet, and awesome furniture. The attention to detail exceeded all of my expectations.  I wish the rooms had looked like this when we got married at the Biltmore.

I do have one additional concern about the all-inclusive package that I want all Yelpers to be aware of - it isn't quite clear how the service charge for restaurants is applied to the vouchers.  When you use a voucher at a resort restaurant they will add a 15% gratuity to the check, so if you want to tip more you just need to add the difference.  However, our server at Wright's didn't explain that to us, so we over-tipped because we didn't think there was a service charge included - so the waiter got a 35% tip, yay for him!

When we checked in the front desk offered us two options: an older room in the main building or a newly updated room with a patio. Ummm....the newly decorated room, please. The room was beautiful and the beds were awesome. I am very picky when it comes to beds in hotels and they were extremely comfortable. We drank and ate poolside at the Ocotillo pool.

He was suppose to be off at 4pm, but stayed longer to continue servicing the busy pool. He was still there at 5pm when we left the pool, but he didn't seem to mind staying late. Smile on his face and sincerity in his voice he continued to service the pool guests. This is how all of your employees should be. We returned to our room later in the evening to find a bottle of prosecco and a card from Eric thanking us for visiting the pool!

Frank Lloyd Wright disowned the authorship of this project since there was disagreement in the design concept between him and the owner. This project was not allowed to be discussed at Taliesin there after the disagreement. When Frank died, the owner wanted an addition to the project. Taliesin Associates agreed to provide the design services, under the leadership of Oligivana Wright. This project then became reassociated with FLLW.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"The Biltmore is superbly impressive from the moment you drive up and keeps your eyes dancing throughout your stay.  So much history and so much charm, this place is part Playboy Mansion, part Neverland Ranch and part Palace of Versailles.  Life size chess sets on the perfectly manicured lawn, fountains at every turn, an undeveloped mountain range as its backdrop, and poolside cabanas fit for Marilyn Monroe (she called the Biltmore her favorite pool).  Indeed, the halls are lined with photographic history of famous guests spanning the resort's opening in 1929 to present day.  (I didn't take a star off for the picture of our current prez who's a repeat guest, but I was tempted).  It makes you feel like royalty to just be there, even if you're an average Joe like me.

I give an enthusiastic A+ to the SERVICE, landscaping, feather-topped bed, and aesthetic appeal/charm of the grounds.  I was most impressed with the service.  With rooms running $600 a night, you don't want to find out that only half of the staff got the five star customer service training.  Biltmore has it down from the front desk to groundskeepers.  A special mention of the 24/7 town cars waiting to pick you up any time you're ready  to step out.

I give an A to the spa which could use a face lift, but nonetheless awarded me the best massage and facial that I've had this millennium.  Also to the in-room dining which was kinda yummy, but lickety-split, the fastest room service I ever had.

I give an A- to the room decor.  They are going for that Mission-style rustic chic, but it looked a little too Hilton and could use less of the ""standardized theme"" decor.  But, the rooms were very well kept and sparkling clean.  I stayed in, and highly recommend, a ""resort deluxe"" room and think it's worth every extra penny to wake up to coffee on your private balcony with a view of the mountains.  

If I hadn't stayed there in the middle of winter I could have played at one of their eight pools. (I'd def hang at the one with the waterslide AND the swim up bar.)  On the flip side, it was nice to have the resort virtually to myself; I had no problem getting room service in less than 1/2 an hour or a couple same-day reservations at the spa.

The conference center and ballrooms are great, with a ton of space for many different needs. The catered food was just okay, with some things being better than others. The logistics/people moving aspects could be better, especially when there are a thousand attendees all trying to get lunch at the same time. 

My room was VERY comfortable, and the bathroom was also nice. The fitness facility is really quite large--larger than I was expecting, and all of the equipment was relatively new. I thought the a/c could have been set a couple degrees cooler, though.

Hotel - I stayed in the main hotel building so it was quite older than the remodeled rooms outside. I got a noisy part of the hotel where I could hear the employees working and dumping stuff.

Restaurants - I've only been to Frank&Alberts because everything else was catered. The service at Frank's was great though!

Service was quite good overall at the hotel. My company did a lot of catering and had our conference there so they were always fast to take away dishes and empty glasses.

Gym - this is important for the people who really do weights. There is a bench bar with an actual bar.

Was very helpful when we wanted to relax and read, etc, but had had our fill of blistering sun by the pool. Nice couches, chair area to relax, computers with internet available, a nice patio with firepit (which thank goodness wasn't lit, too hottt!!!) TVs with news or games on, and always cold drinks available. Coffee, tea, iced tea, sodas, water, and snacks. In the morning they offered a great continental breakfast spread, then from 5-9 beers and wine. very lovely. excellent attentive service.

First off, if you choose not to pay for valet, you have to park very far away (10 minute walk) in the parking garage. This wouldn't be so bad, however once you get to the garage, they provide NO signs showing you the way back to the hotel. I had to ask two different employees where to go as I was heaving my luggage along. 
Finally I made it to the front desk (dripping in sweat from the exercise in my business suit in the hot AZ sun), and I was anxious to check in so that I could rest in the king sized bed that I had reserved. The lady at the front told me that they only had 3 kings left, as if I wasn't important enough to occupy one. This was strike two.
Making it up to my room, there were several other details that I found to be disappointing. First, my room was blazing hot and it took a good 20 minutes to cool down. This was highly frustrating given my arduous journey from the parking lot. Next, I found pubic hairs in the bathtub. I'm not necessarily one to take baths in hotels anyway, but it was still disgusting to see.

In this case we did not use priceline- just a group code so we were in the very corner of the terrace building with a view of the street.  The room was nice and the bed very comfortable, there were quite a few stains on the carpet though and my standard bathtub at home is larger than the tub in the room.

I think priceline and the rooms at the local casinos have spoiled me! For 1/3 of the price we paid here you get waay better there. I would not pay full price to stay here, especially now that I can cross it off my list of places to see.

The terrace building kind of reminds me of the old melrose place show, it has it's own little pool.  There are a lot of pools on the property, I thought the Catalina pool which is all tile was the coolest, it has a fountain that separates the kid's side which is shallow (think 50's).  The front desk said they call it the Marilyn Monroe pool because she always said that it was her favorite pool in the whole world.

Other posters mentioned tours but we were not advised of one.

""Hi Joseph,
Thanks for your email. I hate to complain, but we experienced a few disappointing issues, and I appreciate the opportunity to share. Since becoming Hilton members we've made the effort to choose Hilton properties, including on our staycation. We've generally had good experiences and were surprised at our stay.

I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights, checking in on Father's day to celebrate with my husband, dad and kids. We were impressed that our early check in was accommodated, we were very grateful in fact. Unfortunately, I kind of wish we were told to come back - we had maintenance people turn up looking for a mystery issue they couldn't identify, and while my son was undressed and using the bathroom, a maid came by wanting to take inventory of the mini-bar. I asked if she could please come back a little later, that we needed privacy, and she refused. I was really take back at her refusal to return.

Generally speaking, the property just seemed in rough shape. We get that it's off season, and as locals we are able to take advantage of great rates, but it almost seems that there is an attitude that no one is around to see the mess. But we were :( We stayed in Ocatilla, and the entrance to Cottage K, which we saw every time we came in and out, was full of boxes and trash. The hallways were full of visitors' dishes and trash. On our first afternoon, we came in around lunchtime and used dishes were still sitting in the hallway over night. There was a plate of half eaten food on the ground next to the elevator that sat for our entire visit - it became a joke with the kids wondering if it would still be there the next time we walked by... and every time it was :( The scale in my dad's room didn't work, the shower constantly dripped (more like streaming) and his remote was dead.

One of the days we visited the pool - my dad saw a bat that had fallen into the pool and was swimming around, and alerted a maintenance person. The man who came to help didn't know what to do, so he scooped it up in a cup and dumped it out on the ground. We were concerned about a child or pet getting bitten, but didn't know what else to do :(

On our last day, we asked to check our bags so we could check out on time and visit the pool. We specifically did that so our bags wouldn't sit in our hot car all afternoon. When we were ready to leave, we went to the desk to get our bags and were sent to the bell desk -- outside. Our clothes, 2 laptops, my makeup, and food were sitting out side in the 100+ degree heat for a half day, and where anyone could've walked off with it all :( It seemed like common sense that you wouldn't leave luggage out in the heat all afternoon, in fact it seemed very inconsiderate. 

The experience had the effect on my husband that he wanted to stop spending money when he felt it was no longer a value, and overall, the visit was not relaxing or very enjoyable. This is my second time staying at your property - the first time was so nice, I really wanted to share that experience with my family but this fell very, very short of our anticipation :(

I know your property has a very good reputation, and again, we usually enjoy and are loyal to Hilton. I thought you'd want to know about our experience, thanks for your time.""

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Wow. This is my new favorite hotel. Absolutely, stunningly, gorgeous. I want to live here.

Built in 1928 in collaboration with Frank Lloyd Wright, the Arizona Biltmore is a historic work of art, where attention is paid to every little detail. The grounds are magnificent. The resort is sprawling. The service, impeccable. Its 8 pools and multiple gardens, interconnected by perfectly manicured and dimly lit pathways, cast you into an almost-dreamlike state. At night, cozy your way into a comfy Adirondack chair on the Squaw Peak Lawn, sipping a stiff drink under the soft moonlight, while staring at the twinkling stars that shine above the dry, desert mountainscape. This is how the good life is lived.

The saddest part of my experience was that I was only here on business, and could only barely take advantage of everything the Arizona Biltmore has to offer. Apparently if you like golf, which I don't, then this is one of the best places to get your game on. All of the food on the property was also pretty magnificent -- and that's saying a lot for a work-related event. But then again, the Arizona Biltmore is part of the Waldorf-Astoria collection of hotels, a brand built around exceeding expectations. 

What I do know is that I will be back. And when I come back, it will be for fun and leisure, and hopefully with friends. Time is suspended here. Most of the hotel amenities are open around the clock. Whether you like kicking it around the outdoor fireplace into the wee hours of the night, or want to sip mimosas poolside before the sun starts to rise, you're on your own clock here. There are few rules holding you back from having the time of your life. So take a moment to stop and smell the roses and treat yourself to this art deco desert gem.",5,"[u' favorite hotel', u' good life', u' also pretty', u' own clock']",2.05,"[u' little detail', u' stiff drink']",-0.401785714
v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"We decided to take advantage of a December $99 special to have a night at the Arizona Biltmore before Christmas. What a disappointment!
When we checked in, they asked us where we wanted to stay on the property. They DID NOT offer any explanation of what was avilable, where it was located, etc. We just needed to read their mind, apparently! As it was raining,we choose to stay in the main building. They gave us a room but when we went up to the floor, housekeeping was still in the room! We went back downstairs and were given another roo - by a very disgruntled desk clerk (with a lovely -not- view of the roof). We got settled and then realized we had no heat - (it was an unusually cold, rainy day in AZ) and a light burned out in the bathroom. Maybe we were in a Super 8! We called the desk and they said they would get someone up to look at it. ONE HOUR LATER, a man finally showed up. By now the room was freezing and very uncomfortable. 
We wanted to take a walk around the property and asked if there was a guide or map available. They gave us - I kid you not  - a map on basically a 3x3 card. You could see buildings but certainly none of the labels. At this point, we were beginning to think that the $99 deal is no deal. You can stay there but don't expect ANY service or friendliness.
Trying to shake off our disappointment, we decide to go get something to eat. We ate at Frank and Albert's - another mistake. Soup ordered was barely warm. Very little on the menu for vegetarians, lackluster service, VERY noisy restaurant.
All in all, we won't be back. 
We have stayed at The Boulders in Cave Creek before and our experience there was what you would expect of a Waldorf Astoria property. Beautiful facility - friendly, helpful staff. The Biltmore was the exact opposite. Staff was cold and unfriendly, the accommodations were hugely disappointing.

The furnishings are a bit worn but this is quickly forgotten while relaxing on the patio with a glass of wine.

The garden suites are old but we love the feel of privacy.

The main pool is where all the action is but the Catalina pool is only steps away and serviced well by the wait staff and much quieter.

There is a small cafe to grab some pastry and coffee on the run. If you need a bloody mary to get your day started try the Frank and Alberts bar. Its the only place early in the morning.

Pros:
1 - great grounds- beautiful
2 - restaurants are good
3 - pools are nice

Cons:
- pooljumpers everywhere - these nonpaying guests were smoking IN the pool and occupied a paid cabana without paying - kinda loud and very obvious from their conversation they were not paid guests. When I mention to lounge attendant was basically told nothing could be done about it - two times!!!! I don't understand that - I paid over $300 a night for an exclusive pool and people sneak in without paying and I am told ""nothing could be done about it"". 
- We saw a young couple (non-Ocatilla residents) almost procreate in the pool. She truly was acting like a stripper and NO employee said or did a thing- and there were kids there- not to mention everyone else trying to enjoy their afternoon.
- No exclusivity for the Ocatilla pool. They didn't monitor who used the pool even though we paid extra for the exclusivity. Rumor around the pool was that due to the rush of Memorial Day, the resort opened up all pools to all guests. Then why did they market the exclusivity of the pool to us and we paid for it? 
- With Ocatilla we were told we would have unlimited beer/wine in the Executive Lounge. Arrive to Ocatilla to find it is only from 5pm to line 8pm. And it wasn't just us that were basically misinformed. WE met at least four other couples/groups that were told the same thing or at least extended hours for the free unlimited beer and wine. Someone was misinforming numerous guests either on purpose or by mistake- either way, big mistake.
- The on duty manager comp'd us $120 to our room to make up for the above, but for the amount we were paying, that honestly didn't make too much of a difference. $120 bucks didn't make up for a ruined pool experience. 

When I called to discuss with the manager later before posting this review (and I advised I would be posting this review), his assistant and I had a long discussion and she understood my issues and concerns. However, I still have not heard from the manager regarding these complaints.

It is a shame because it is a beautiful place that is worth checking out BUT DO NOT PAY FOR THE EXCLUSIVITY OF OCATILLA!

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Known as ""The Jewel of the Desert"" and the ""Grand Dame,"" this beautiful hotel is the only one in the world with a Frank Lloyd Wright-influenced design.  The architect was a man named Albert Chase McArthur, who had studied under Frank Lloyd Wright.  Hence, the main restaurant's name is ""Frank and Albert's.""

Celebrating its 80th birthday this year, this unique art-deco resort is rich in history.  Dozens of presidents have golfed here, Marilyn Monroe splashed around in one of the 8 on-site pools, and many more celebrities and industry magnates have called this their temporary home.

When visiting here, it is important to note that on-site parking is costly.  A self parking fee of $12 is imposed even on its guests, and the self parking lot is often located some distance from the hotel entrance.  For those not wanting to bother with parking the car themselves, the price is$27 to valet.  The package I purchased luckily had the self-parking included, but the car was delivered to the valet nonetheless.  I was sure to speak to a hotel manager about how ridiculous it is to ask a hotel guest to pay for parking, and he happily credited our room for the valet fee.

So, my first experience was our dinner at ""Frank and Albert's"", formerly known as the ""Biltmore Grill.""  Local purveyors provide the ingredients for nearly all of its organic dishes.  From Queen Creek Olive Oil to Shriner's Sausage, Mesa Ranch Goat Cheese to Biltmore grown Rosemary, one can taste the difference.  The menu provided a range of selections from salads, pizzas, and flatbreads, to rotisserie and classic comfort foods.  The wood stone baked filet of salmon was flavorful, tender, and full of tender feelings. I recommend their ""bloody rose"" cocktail.  I snicker as I write these words, because bloody marys are my least favorite cocktail.  However, this unique blend is made with crop organic tomato vodka and juice, fresh biltmore grown rosemary and spices.  Service was attentive and timely, waiter was very knowledgeable, and we were very impressed with the quality and flavor of the food.  

Next, it was on to the newly added wing of the resort, the Ocatilla.  The Ocatilla is essentially a new boutique hotel situated on the Biltmore property.  It has its own pool, a concierge, and an executive lounge which offers daily complimentary breakfasts, a light evening fare, beer and wine, desserts, as well as coffee and soft drinks.Our package included a room on the third floor of this location, as well as access to its executive lounge.  

Although our stomachs were full from dinner, we made room for chocolate covered cheesecake, choc. covered strawberries, fudge brownies, tarts, and chocolate chunk cookies.  We swallowed it all down with some prosecco, and headed up to our room.

The room was at least 500sq feet, and I believe that the rest of the hote has fairly sizeable rooms, as well.  The decor was a blend of art deco and southwestern.  The bathroom with its granite countertops, boasted a tub with sea salts and candle, in which we submerged ourselves comfortably up to our chins.  Two plush robes were there for us to lounge around in.  A snack bar was provided, although a package of nuts and dried fruit was $7.  Biggest disappointment was that that there was no wetbar.  I always look forward to these in any hotel room, especially to use them for storing leftovers from dinner.  The king bed was etremely comfortable, with its pillow-top mattress and feather pillows, as well as the high thread count sheets.  Silky soft...

We enjoyed peace and quiet all night, and were not disturbed in the morning by housekeeping.

The next day were were early to rise to enjoy the lavish continental breakfast spread in the lounge.  Granola with local pecans and yogurt parfait croissans with spinach and boursin, ham and cheese, small danishes, assortmnt of fresh fruits and juices gave us the perfect start to our day.  We grabbed some bottled waters and cokes and headed to the pool.  We had an appointment at the spa an hour later, for seaweed wraps and massages, and it was wonderful, the service excellent and very personalized.

Recommendations:
go to biltmore's website directly to book a room. you will find incredible packages. our package was $200 and included dinner for two, lunch for two, 50% off at the spa, and access to the executive lounge at the ocatilla.

if you live locally, they will shuttle you - saves the parking headache.

About Ocatilla:
basically an upgrade with your stay. For an additional $75-$100/day, these are the following amenities you will receive:
complimentary beverages, wine, beer, breakfast, light evening fare, and desserts in the lounge
business center (computers, internet, printers)
Wii rentals

Our room wasn't cleaned the entire 3 days we were there, even after we asked the front desk to send housekeeping. That didn't get us down--after all, we didn't come there to hang out in our room.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I don't understand the 4-stars folks.  Yes, the outside is pretty, yes, FLW did a great job on the design.  But you can come for lunch and see all that.  There's no reason to actually stay here.  The rooms are completely falling apart.  I had to move from my first one because the a/c sounded like a jack hammer AND the toilet didn't work.   The second one's carpet was soaking wet and the toilet worked...sometimes.  But after waiting an HOUR for the bellman to bring my key for the first move (when they originally said 10-15 minutes) I just sucked it up and stayed in the second broken room so I wouldn't be late for my meeting.

Some of the food is pretty good and there are some creative options (the Ranch Stack at breakfast, the duck-fat poached fries at lunch).  But the service varied widely.  At Frank & Albert's, I had a bartender make me a to-go order who was so friendly and helpful.  The next day at brunch the waiter totally forgot about me and I couldn't get a refill and eventually had to ask someone else to bring me my check.  Plus, the room service took forever. 

I also had a few spa treatments.  The massage was so good that I sought out a comment card to let her manager know.  I believe her name was Katie.  The facial was very mediocre and only lasted 38 minutes  (rather than 50 as advertised).  I wouldn't say my skin was in great condition afterward.  And the facialist was also trying to sell me some cleansing brush and products.  Not my favorite relaxing experience.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Spent a little time here the week of July 4. I found it to be a very smooth and pleasant experience overall. I requested a room with a mountain view and got one in the main building with an amazing vista over the back lawn towards Piestawa Peak. I could have stared at it for hours. The room itself was compact but not oppressively so. It was a little tight where the corners of the desk, bed and ottoman came together, so watch your shins there if you have a main building room. The bed was super comfortable and the Frank Lloyd Wright influence of the design carries over to the room, especially in the headboard and lamps. The bathroom is pretty plain, like something at a Marriott convention hotel. My only real complaint about the rooms is that they really could use a little more attention to the dusting, especially on the clock radio and picture frame surfaces. Bathroom was spotless, though. 

The lobby is very soothing architecturally and really defines a sense of something special. There are vintage photos of the hotel spread throughout the rooms and public areas, so you get a real sense of the history of this place. The two main restaurants, Frank & Albert's and Wright, are at the end of the lobby, with Wright's lounge occupying a large block of space just outside Wright's restaurant. F&A's had a nice happy hour, with a few appetizers and drink specials at a good rate. The pulled barbecued pork taco was yummy. 

The grounds are gorgeous desert landscaping, with FLW's sprite statues punctuating the plantings. The main pool was a little meh to me, so I chose to hang out at the quieter Catalina Pool, where Marilyn Monroe swam and which is lined with Catalina tiles. It had fewer people, but a few noisy pre-teens who were splashing about. So keep in mind, it's billed as a ""quiet pool"", not an ""adults-only pool"". 

Service throughout was gracious and very efficient. I was able to check in at 10:30 am and an early check-in will always make me very pleased. Also, the A/C was set to 68 degrees when I went in my room. Usually, they turn it up higher and you have to cool it down. Prices in the convenience store were high even by resort standards ($3 for a can of Diet Coke?) and the TV channel selection was limited (no HGTV?! Barbarous!).

I wanted my wife to experience the old world charm of a turn-of-the-century charmer.  NOT!  The historic lobby, which is the soul of the complex was UNDER CONSTRUCTION. That would have been good to know - but NEVER on the website or in any communication was this called out.  The entire place was a ""work-around"", with this not in service and that in service.  This alone was a severe disappointment.

Second - this is definitely ONLY a Hilton in resort garb.  The wait service was spotty.  Restaurant service was generally ""okay"" but at the bars we seemed invisible.  At poolside (two times) we had to wait 20 minutes then go to the pool bar to get attention, only to hear - it's early in the season so we are not fully staffed. Uh, what??  A resort claiming 4 or 5 stars is NEVER understaffed, rather it should feel overstaffed.  Our housekeeping was spotty as well.  And, outside our bungalow - for three days - sat light bulbs from overheads that needed changing as well as wine glasses, cocktail glasses and other room service items that sat on a planter wall the entire time.  Might as well be living in West Las Vegas for all I could see. 

Then, there were the little things.  Like toilet paper you'd expect at a truck stop.

And we weren't the only ones.  At breakfast one day, we met a sales director who'd brought 150 of his team to the Biltmore and was shocked - SHOCKED - that he had not been informed of the renovation and construction.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I won't be coming back.

I came here for a conference in April 2012. The hotel itself is a little run down.  Several people I talked to had problems with their rooms needing repairs. The grounds are attractive as long as you don't look to close. The property has the square block style of Frank Lloyd Wright design, and many of the blocks and mortar are in need of repair. 

On our first night here we walked with our two young kids to one of the restaurants on the property. We were seated immediately, then left after 20 minutes when nobody came by our table. Went back to the room and ordered room service (young kids getting very hungry and cranky by this time) and we were told 45 minutes for the order. Ok. It took an hour and a half. I told them we have four people eating but they only sent settings and drinks for two. Fine - we'll take it at this point.

The next morning we were awakened by a maintenance worker in our room. ""You have a problem with your bathroom light?"" uhhhh....no and why did you let yourself in to our room without knocking? No apology, he just left. Strange.

There are some nice things about this place. For kids, it is great. They have an awesome water slide and countless pools. There is a shaded play area for kids that rivals many community parks.

OF NOTE:
-The public areas of the hotel and the grounds are spectacular and are being properly maintained.  Everywhere you look, the eye peacefully rests on something beautiful of organic form or origin (with the possible exception of the main pool, see below).
-Multiple low-key areas for lounging inside and out (with shade)
-Tastefully appointed, updated room, not trendy or overdone
-Restful, historic Catalina pool with walled-off shallow section for little ones
-The 18 hole putting course is a blast!  Sadly we did not have time for a round of golf so I can't comment on the course.  
- The onsite retail shops have a wide selection of fashionable and useful items for both men and women.  
- Location is convenient to the airport, nearby shopping and all Scottsdale has to offer.

NEEDS IMPROVEMENT:
- The main pool has an awkward layout and the afternoon social scene (during a concomitant CPA convention!) reminded me of a Vegas party pool.  We actually had to walk through the gated pool area behind a tarped-off ice machine and service area to reach the front door of our villa.  From the historic photos of the property, you can see that the perimeters of this pool area have been maxed out to accommodate the private cabanas - are those really such a big thing? - bar and dining area.  One morning there was a huge pile of ice melting on the walkway we had to pass through.  
- Food inconsistencies: The roasted vegetables served at the event banquet I attended on the lawn were fabulous.  The lunch food at Frank and Albert's was just so-so.  We did not have an opportunity to dine in the main restaurant.
- Service inconsistencies - Banquet and bell service excellent.  Exceptional yoga instructor on the morning I attended.  However....pool towels seem to only be available at the main pool - you have to pick them up there and schlep to the Catalina pool.  Table service in the restaurant lagging during a slow lunch hour.  Housekeeping staff failed to re-stock coffee bar. Cocktail waitress promised several times to light our table firebowl but kept ""forgetting"".  When queried, recreation staff failed to inform me that nature walk had to be ""pre-booked"" - and walk had already departed when I showed up 10 min early.  
- Spa overpriced.  My 90 min facial came to over $450 with ""automatic"" gratuity but the value was not there.

Greeting and farewell at front desk were not particularly warm or gracious. Attention to detail by restaurant staff in preparing a private party was lacking and we needed to follow up with them several times to make sure they delivered as promised. Unlike other top resort hotels, service is not polished or personal.  

The rooms in the Ocatilla building are fine but not particularly well designed. The shower door, bathroom door, and door to the toilet all collided. Our patio was very small and practically useless. The lounge for the Ocatilla building was pretty nice but very far from our room. Strangely,the concierge for the lounge didn't recognize us on our third day. It kind of epitomizes the level of service at the Biltmore.

Upon check-out, we were told that our gift card had no value and were accused of having stolen the card! When I asked for an apology and suggested that perhaps there could be another explanation (i.e. YOUR HOTEL STAFF MESSED UP and didn't activate this card when our friend purchased it!!!), I was told that there was no other explanation except that the card must have been stolen. I demanded to speak with a manager who essentially fed me the exact same insults.

We left after being asked to pay for our entire bill in full and then the next nightmare began....

The woman from our church who purchased our gift card was appalled that we were treated so horribly and luckily she had her receipt from her online purchase. When she called the hotel, she was assured that everything would be taken care of promptly and that we would be credited back the amount of our gift card immediately. One week passed....no word. I called the Biltmore and was connected to a voice mail box for Sarah, the staff member responsible for gift cards. No return call. I called again two days later and was again connected to the same voice mail. No return call.  I called a third time. No return call. Three weeks had now passed since our stay at the hotel and I called AGAIN. I was about to be connected to the same voice mailbox when I said, ""NO, I do not want Sarah's extension. I want to talk to someone NOW."" At long last I was connected to Beth, a manager of some kind.

Beth informed me that the finance department had recently approved our refund, and said we would just need to allow some time for it to appear on our credit card statement. When I asked why NO ONE HAD EVER CONTACTED US, she said that Sarah (my friend with FOUR messages from me on her voice mail) had been told numerous times to call me and Beth was surprised to hear that she hadn't done so. When I asked Beth if she knew our entire situation--that we'd been accused of stealing a gift card, she said yes, she'd heard of our experience and was shocked. She apologized and assured me that the staff members we'd dealt with had been ""spoken to"", but I was irritated that I had to bring up our extremely insulting situation and she didn't offer an apology outright. If I hadn't asked her about it, she would not have even mentioned it. 

Beth offered us a ""great deal"" if we wanted to return to the hotel. I had to laugh. Was she serious? As if we would ever think of staying at this hotel again! 

We did eventually receive our refund, as well as a letter of apology from the hotel. I can't believe that an upscale establishment would treat its clients so poorly. Why in the world would they jump to the conclusion that we were thieves, instead of immediately apologizing for our inconvenience at having received an invalid gift card? Why would they demand payment from us in full, instead of graciously letting us leave and then following up on the purchase history of our gift card? They had our credit card on file and could have billed us later if in fact there was any issue or amount due. Why would they refuse to communicate with us to assure us that our situation was being dealt with?

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"in summary:  worthwhile, but NOT a 5-star hospitality experience.

in detail:

a belated birthday celebration for my mom, a huge FLW fan, i agonized over whether to book in the original rooms, or spring for the chi-chi ocatilla experience.  i went with the latter in the end, and am not convinced it was necessarily a better choice.  the 'club'/lounge was the usual for the hilton group - posh enough, varied places to sit, attentive staff, yummy choices.  it was nice, and for that, worth the upgrade. 
 
the room and the hallways though - meh.  it felt like any old hilton just with nice historic photos on the walls and slightly-stylized furnishings.  a lot of the reviews i read mentioned the original rooms being run down - well, i would say ocatilla was no better.    right when we walked in i noticed the doorstop was actually pushed in through the drywall - classy!  the door shut and locked but in a remarkably loose manner that my mom was nervous about.  then there was the HVAC issue.  every time the air cycled on or off, it made this horrible crashing/clunking sound - literally like part of the duct was loose and making serious contact with another part of the duct.  my mom's a light sleeper so though while it was late - 11ish - and i figured they'd say there was nothing they could do about it, or move us, i rang, and the facilities guys arrived shortly thereafter.  and guess what?  yep - the shrug/'nothing we can do about it' response, and of course i couldn't get it to make the noise when they were there.  we were both so tired we managed to sleep through it.  
when i mentioned it politely at checkout (i hate complaining), the lady at the desk was super cool about it and took off the resort charge and/or parking, i forget - anyway, at least there was something.  that said, it shouldn't have that many issues in a newer structure at a '5-star' resort.

a 5-star experience is, when you ring for room service, 'good evening, miss [your last name], what can i get for you?' not just 'room service; what would you like?'....which of course is better than a curt 'what?!' but again, 5-star it is not quite.   

at dusk or so, we walked around the resort and through the original structure and then took a dip in the pools - THAT part was all very nice.  the grounds are impeccable.  the pools very clean and tidy.  the staff polite.  there's an amazing history room, though i don't think that's what it's called, but it was awesome - like walking into a records vault.  it's also nice that they have the historic photos up and that there's all the architecture/FLW books in the rooms - appropriate; considering the history they shouldn't do any less.  

all that said, the night we were there, i think just about every single event space they had was booked - it was a hugely busy time - so in that light, in the end, we were glad to be in the 'outbuilding' that is ocatilla.  
next time we'll try the original rooms, though suspending any sort of 5-star expectation.",3,"[u' original rooms', u' attentive staff', u' original rooms', u' light sleeper', u' super cool', u' many issues', u' original structure', u' very nice', u' very clean', u' amazing history', u' also nice', u' original rooms']",5.598333333,"[u' serious contact', u' so tired']",-0.733333333

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I have always wanted to stay at the Biltmore, and thanks to a great deal this Labor Day weekend (and my boyfriend's Hotels.com points) I finally was able to make it happen. It was a mix of highs and lows, but overall, I would give it 4 stars.

Checking was a pain. The lady who helped us wasn't friendly and seemed annoyed. She also didn't give us very good directions to our room. After checking in, we attempted to self-park. Unfortunately, there were absolutely zero parking spots free. We ended up back at valet, which we were not aware costs $27/night.

Although it was a pain finding our room, at least we had the beautiful grounds to admire while we looked. Once we got into the room, I was definitely happy with the accommodations. We had a 4th floor room with a large balcony and a view of a Camelback Mountain. The room itself was large, and the bed was super comfy. The only thing that was kind of weird is there was a large empty space in the room that would have been perfect for a couch or anything really. Maybe the Biltmore just wanted us to have more room for activities?

We ventured to one of the smaller pools to avoid the crowds at the main pool. The servers still make the rounds at the small pool, and our waitress was quick and checked in plenty of times to see if we needed anything. Of course, the drink prices are ridiculous, but we did see quiet a few people with their own alcohol (note to self for next time).

That night we ate dinner at the Wright Bar, which was just okay, mostly do to the service (the waitress spilled a glass of red wine on my boyfriend's white shirt but still charged us full price for everything). We spent the rest of the night back at the pool, which is open 24 hours. After a great night's sleep, we woke to a bill under the door for an additional $60 for valet parking and the resort fee. I figured there might be a resort fee, but when we checked in, we specifically asked and were told we had already prepaid for everything and the credit card was just for incidentals. My boyfriend spoke to a manager and explained the situation. The manager was great and took care of the fees and even let us have a 2 p.m. check out.

Overall, the grounds are immaculate, and it's neat to stay somewhere so full of history--our room had a picture of Ronald Reagan's registration card from when he stayed here for his honeymoon.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"Gorgeous room, gorgeous property. Front desk was warm & friendly and check in/check out was quick. 

Here's why it lost a few stars for me: 
-The parking: I called ahead of time and was told self parking was free. Parking was limited and finding a spot was basically like adult musical chairs. And then at check out I'm told parking is NOT free and was charged 12.00. 
-The pool experience: It took me 15 minutes to get towels at the main pool. There was a couple ahead of me making arrangements for their cabana. To my surprise, the guy behind the counter was also the person who walked them to their cabana and got them situated. There was NO one else behind the counter on a Saturday afternoon. I watched him walk back with no urgency, which added to my irritation. There were also not enough shaded chairs. My husband and I eventually left to go find a smaller, less crowded pool (try the Ocotilla pool if you're fine getting your own drinks).
-The room service: Their in-room menus say they will be happy to accommodate gluten-free meal requests, but when I asked what *WAS* gluten free, the guy I spoke to had no idea. He said, ""I THINK the huevos rancheros, but I'm not really sure."" When I asked if he could check the ingredient list for the tortillas, he said there was none. We ordered the food anyway, and when the guy showed up with our order, he said he DID check the label that suddenly existed and saw the tortillas did have gluten. I don't understand why he didn't call back to ask us if we wanted something else, because that's what ended up happening anyway, and as a result, I waited about 45 minutes longer than I needed to.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"What a shame. As my high school counselor once told me, ""so much potential, but....""  ;)

The Frank Lloyd Wright design is just beautiful. But in the same way you just don't need to sleep in a Ferrari, you don't need to stay here either. Come visit for lunch or dinner and check out the beautiful property, because the Frank & Albert's restaurant is great, and now that i mention it, the BREAKFAST there was fantastic. The kindest, smartest, nicest wait staff in the morning, and the food is just so creative and different, yet so tasty. But i digress.

The problem is that it's an old building. And with old buildings, come problems, even though it's been remodeled. The walls are thin, so you can hear your neighbors getting into arguments or getting it on with perfect clarity, neither one of which you really want to hear while on vacation. And you can hear the drunk people walking and yelling down the halls at 2am, 3am, and even 4am. I'm not making any of this up as I lived through it, all in 1 night. And the a/c units are loud, because again, it's an old building and that's just the way it is.

The rooms are a good size, around 500 square feet, and well designed and furnished. Which makes it even more of a shame that you can't really enjoy it.

And if you're thinking about staying at the Ocatilla building, that's where I stayed. So you can't escape the riff raff by staying there either.

As another guest correctly points out, the Ocatilla side is not worth the extra dollars. That definitely over promises and under delivers. The pool is not exclusive to Ocatilla guests, as no one monitors the area, so you have people who pool hop who shouldn't be there. You can't find a server to save your life to get a drink at the pool either, so you have to walk out to get your own. 

The Ocatilla concierge folks are extremely nice as can be, but their niceness doesn't walk the hallways and pick up trash or room service trays that sit out in the hallways all day long without being picked up. The ""free"" breakfast is simply bagels, muffins, fruit, juice and coffee. Puts the con in continental breakfast, if you ask me.

And one of the strangest parts is that if you drive yourself there (I rented a car from the airport), the parking is like Star Wars and is far far away. Even valet doesn't help because the Ocatilla building is in the back of the property with no parking near it, which doesn't seem like a big deal except when it's 108 degrees outside. AND they charge $12 extra for even self parking. That's bad, especially when the parking is so inconvenient.

And the $28 resort fee on top of paying extra for the Ocatilla rooms? While having ""free"" wifi by the pool was nice, i don't know what the other $18 difference is for since you still have to tip people and tip the maid. I've stayed at other resorts with ""resort fees"" that include tips for everyone, so i get it and like it since i don't have to carry cash for deliveries and doormen and concierge, but i think the Biltmore doesn't quite realize that resort fees weren't designed to get more money from guests: it was originally intended to make our lives easier so that we don't have to worry about tipping and carrying money!

So i'll stop being a downer. The staff was extremely friendly, the rooms were well designed and super clean, and the property is beautiful. I stayed for 6 nights and ate at Frank & Alberts 5 times (1x dinner, 2x breakfast, 2x lunch). 4 out of 5 of the meals were fantastic, so that's a pretty great batting average for any restaurant. As mentioned in the beginning, go there to eat, hang out, get a drink, and enjoy the beautiful property. Heck, even stay there in a non-Ocatilla room for a few nights, but make sure your room is far far away from the elevator.",2,"[u' just beautiful', u' beautiful property', u' so creative', u' perfect clarity', u' good size', u' extremely nice', u' extremely friendly', u' super clean', u' pretty great', u' beautiful property']",6.6,[u' so inconvenient'],-0.6

However, until that heavenly day comes, I will be content with doing a relaxing spa day here and there when my pocket books lets me. 

This spa excels in customer service, amenities and services. First of all, the customer service is sublime. They aren't pushy but they are always available. They keep a smile on their face and aim to please without being overly aggressive or coming off sarcastic. The amenities are state of the art. During a spa day, you have access to the tennis courts which are right outside the gym doors, the gym and their equipment that's perfect (especially their treadmills with personal tvs), a jacuzzi, sauna, resort pool and more. You can also partake in a group hike, group bike ride or several other daily activities they offer.

I was disappointed in the poolside menu. The portions are gigantic and over priced (higher than any resort at which I have had the fortune to crash)- way, way, way too big for somebody like me who just wants a quick bite to eat. Who wants to stuff themself when they're in public in their bathing suit (teeny bikini)? And there's no point asking for a to-go box because the leftovers would spoil in the sun and heat. So I ordered a ""cooked poolside"" taco for $5 and a fruit bowl for $5 (reasonably priced). I was stuffed after that.

Room service: where 30 minutes is 45, medium well is bloody on all but the very outside surface of your burger, the burger comes completely nude - no lettuce, tomato, nothin', your server asks if you want that stuff and that he thought it was weird it wasn't on there, heads down to pick it up for you as your uncovered burger sits out looking all expectant and embarrassed while some bird shrieks its snacky intent through the open door while eyeballing your lunch and salivating, your server comes back several minutes later with a saran wrapped plate featuring one giant lettuce leaf, a slice of red onion, a small tomato, a pickle spear and a fruit fly.  Really?  Did the person wrapping that up NOT notice the fly, drowning in pickle juice right on top of the heap as they wrapped it?  Ew.  I was really looking forward to that pickle too.  No, it's not the end of the world, but it's a lack of attention to detail which I find frustrating at ""high end"" hotels.  I wasn't the only one with a woeful room service experience so I don't think it was a fluke.
The interiors (sleeping and meeting rooms and hallway) really could use some sprucing, much as I try to focus on the charm and overlook the wrinkles.  The architecture is still as amazing as ever though.  I hear they're redoing the lobby soon, but I thought the lobby was fine.  Word on the streets is that you might not want one of those rooms attached to said lobby if you're looking for a good night's sleep by the way.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"In a very upscale hotel like the Arizona Biltmore, I expect high standards.  But when I stepped into the shower on Monday morning, 11/19/12, I was stung by a large scorpion.  My friend was able to kill the scorpion and call the front desk.  They sent security with insect sting wipes and got some basic information but I never heard from anyone in the hotel again, even to see if I was alive.  As a result, I was incapacitated for 2 of the 4 days I stayed at the property and unable to walk.  When I checked out on 11/21/12 I asked the front desk clerk if he was aware of my problem and he was not.  He comped a $29 meal charge and said he would have the manager call me later that day.  I have yet to be contacted by anyone. I understand that ""it's the desert"" and ""you have to watch out for scorpions"" but I have never even seen a scorpion before and certainly did not expect to see one in the 3rd floor shower stall of a pricey resort. (We had even upgraded to the Ocatillo.)  I am appalled at the lack of concern by hotel staff.  It was a completely ruined vacation and I would never stay at this property again.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I stayed here for a recent business conference during September. The resort was definitely a nice experience. Upon check in I had a room in the Ocatilla. The room was well appointed, spacious and clean - clearly a recent renovation that was well done. 

Due to some mobility issues, I asked to be moved to a room closer to the location of the majority of my events I had to attend and I was quickly transferred to  a private cottage near the Frank Lloyd Wright ballroom. The cottage was not nearly as nice as the room in the Ocatilla. The cottage was dated and even smelled that way. However, it was clean, quiet and definitely closer to where I needed to be. 

The room was okay for working. There was a small desk with wired internet access. However, in order to plug in my computer I had to drop down on my hands and knees and find the outlet. Outlets were also available next to one of the nighstands which is great since I use my phone as my alarm clock.

The staff was quite kind and would pick me up on a golf cart and transfer me around the property as needed (I understand that this service is always available and you need only call the front desk to request it).  Front desk staff, concierge and bell hops were all professional, eager and willing to assist, and happy to answer questions.

The restaurants, Frank & Albert's, was exceptional - both in quality of food and service. I dined there for lunch one day and breakfast on another. Both times I was very pleased with the taste of the food (excellent mid-western menu) and the friendliness and professionalism of the servers. Never once did we have to ask for anything and on both occasions the server thought ahead to prepare to go drinks for once we moved outside of the restaurant and onto the patio.

The grounds of the hotel are fantastic. There are tons of chair/tables for you to sit at and chat with colleagues/friends and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The bar was as impressive as the restaurant. The meeting facilities are also nice though spread out a bit.

We stayed in the Ocatilla building, which offers you the concierge lounge.  This is really a great feature.  We hung out in there each day, and enjoyed the snacks and drinks.  Also the staff is outstanding and very helpful.

My only complaint was breakfast.  It was definitely continental style and didn't offer much.

This is definitely a Waldorf Hotel.  I have said this before, and I will say it again, its old.  But the grounds are beautiful.  The architecture is amazing.  You have to stay here if you are a Frank Lloyd Wright fan.  The overall design wouldn't be my choice, but it is unique.

We liked our hotel room.  Spacious with a fridge, robes, a great tub and shower, and the bed was heaven.

We LOVED the pool.  Again, great service, nice atmosphere, clean, and lots of clean towels.

We self parked, and its a bit of a hike.  We didn't mind it, but when it is 105 outside, you are sweating by the time you reach your car.

We had a happy hour of sorts at the Wright Bar.  They don't really have happy hour here, but they do serve some smaller dishes that are options at the restaurants on site.  It was good.

They do have a car service at the hotel.  We definitely took advantage of this, as it was only 10 bucks to get to the Biltmore Mall, so we could enjoy our evening out at Capital Grille with our wine and get back safely.",4,"[u' great feature', u' great tub', u' great service', u' clean towels', u' happy hour', u' happy hour']",4.366666667,[u' only complaint'],-0.15

Being a Waldorf Astoria resort and part of the Hilton family, I expected a bed as comfy as one finds in a Hilton. My bed was definitely not that soft. The room size was larger than average and the tv was new. The bathroom showed signs of age, peeling paint on ceiling and scuffs on the door.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"This review is for the Thanksgiving dinner buffet served in the Gold Room at the Arizona Biltmore on Thursday November 26th. We had 1:30 reservations and arrived 5 minutes early. For some reason we were seated outside on the patio, surrounded by empty tables as  everyone else was seated inside. I thought it was odd at first but the weather was beautiful and I thought better to be outside with the garden view than inside with all the crowds of people. 

Within 30 seconds our server was at our table. She said her name was Nic, like Nic at night. She welcomed us and made us feel like we were her only guests. Offered us complementary champagne and showed us inside to the unbelievable buffet. 

We started with the small plates, crab & avocado, herb poached shrimp, truffle lobster medallions, seriously good food. We then hit the cheese and fruit station filled with imported cheeses, meats, olives and assorted breads. The entrees were also incredible as they featured a carving station with roasted tom turkey, prime rib & maple glazed ham. Other entrees & sides included coriander dusted sea bass with lemon cream, Lavender glazed chicken, baked cauliflower with walnuts, sage sourdough stuffing, garlic mashed potatoes and of course gravy. 

Our server Nic continued to keep our champagne glasses full while all the time making sure we had everything we needed, replacing cloth napkins and silverware as needed. 

In the end, even though I did not think I could eat another bite, I managed to try the cherries jubilee made fresh with a splash of Grand Mariner and scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"When my AC busted a few weeks ago I found myself staying in a suite here for the weekend.  Ok, so it's not how I usually roll, but luckily some out-of-town friends scored a suite here and my bad luck met with perfect timing to equal an over-the-top silver lining for the weekend.

The Arizona Biltmore pools alone warrant five stars, but the service and suite were nothing to look past either. The two room suite was comfortable, spacious and tastefully decorated. The living room and bedrooms had a subtle Southwestern decor that I surprisingly didn't hate.  

The architecture and landscaping of the grounds was just as legendary as you would expect. Calling for extra towels was a cinch and took only a few minutes for them to arrive. The housekeeper we flagged down in the hallway gladly took photos of us on the balcony and repeatedly tried to refuse our $5 tip for his trouble. We weren't having it.

Finally, the pool experience was second to none. Like giddy school kids, the Biltmore waterslide became a 20-something playground for an hour. From what I could tell the poolside was a mix of locals and tourists as I recognized some people (incl. JohnJay from KISS 104.7).

The best part of swimming on a Saturday afternoon at the Biltmore? 
 * The salsa demonstration (with a dozen or so salsas and chips prepared by the sous chef) was so extensive it was our lunch! 
 * Swim up to the bar (or sneak your own drinks and pass it off like you bought it) and buy a $10 margarita. 
 * Score a cabana rental if at all possible.  You get your own private shower, bathroom, AC'ed room, umbrellas, TV, patio chairs and server.  And it is well worth it.

v9u0NgjA4iQeKGevFnYSCA,"I wanted to be fair and give an update to the review I wrote last week. I received a call from a manager at the hotel, Beth, and she was really receptive to my feedback and extremeley apologetic. She treated me with the respect and sincere concern that EACH guest deserves on EVERY visit. It is just as I suspected and the Ocatilla section was full that evening. We both agreed that an honest explanation, given initially before lying to me,  would've been the most appropriate way to handle the situation. I was able to voice my issues and I received an appropriate apology. Thank you Beth for the follow up. 

I would hope that no one else has the experience that I had, but I know that things happen. Accountability, humility, and respect for guests is what keeps a hotel in business.  I know for a fact that the Biltmore doesn't want to be considered just another hotel, so perhaps they will step it up in customer service consistency. They have a rich history behind them so they really need to go above and beyond and live up to their Waldorf Astoria backing. While talking to Beth, I agreed to give the hotel another chance to make things right and I'm confident the next time will be better.

I've been to this one, well, let's just say more than several times.  The food is always.... uneventful.  It's not one of those specifically great or specifically bad ones.  It's just..... fine?  The only really good thing I got there once was their big breakfast.  It was only McDonald's good, but man it tasted good that day.

After he poured the dressing on the salad and tasted it, he realized it wasn't blue cheese (tasted like rancid ranch) so we sent it back.  The manager brought back the new salad and asked again what happened to the first and after repeating it, he actually didn't say much about it.  Now we realize the new $10+ salad didn't have any chicken on it so we told our waitress when she finally got around to checking on us.  She chuckled at the fact that the manager didn't catch this oversight.  The manager finally comes around with a cup of cubed chicken (don't know why it took as long as it did when the chicken, I'm sure, is pre-cooked and premeasured) and before he places it down on the table, he gives the salad a once over, as if to make sure that it, in fact, didn't have any chicken in it.

And that's neither a good thing nor bad thing.  In other words, I traveled all the way from Tucson to Northern Phoenix to eat an all right burger.  Well, that's not true.  My friend and I traveled there to watch Avatar on the IMAX screen at Desert Ridge.  

To reiterate, the burgers at Islands are ""fine"" in the mildest possible term.  The ground beef was of decent to good quality, and therefore the taste was of average to good caliber.  It was the fixings that sort of dragged down the burger in the taste department.  I ordered the Kilauea, which is a jalapeno & black pepper crusted burger with pepper jack cheese, chipotle aioli, lettuce,
tomato and Island Reds.  I'm not a cheese fan, so I opted to forgo the pepper jack.  I'm not sure if that would've saved the burger.  The seasoning lacked any pronounced or distinguished flavor.  Sadly, the end result was a rather bland burger.  

Have mercy, the fries, on the other hand, were probably the best thing on my plate.  The fries at Islands were good and fresh, just like me with the ladies after a few drinks.  With all due respect to a review who said that the fries ""tasted a lot like In-N-Out's,"" I disagree.  In-N-Out fries are of the thin-cut variety, while Island's are more of a traditional style.  What I appreciated the most about the fries were that they were crispy and fresh.  

The service was fairly fast, efficient and friendly, especially considering this a California-based chain.  I hate to wait for refills on my drinks, and our server was always on the spot just prior to hitting bottom as to satiate our impending thirst.  By the way, if you order a Cherry Coke here, it comes with an actual maraschino cherry.  Well, the first one does at least.  The second and third ones lacked any cherry.  I guess once you pop that first cherry, you really don't get any more.

Majerles is small but laid out well with the bar in the center with smaller high-tops encircling it with booths along the outer wall.

kHpXJ2vciumu2KhNHg0hYA,"I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.

Yes, Majerle's is worse.  

Okay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.

The set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  

Moreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  

The bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.

I wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US.",1,"[u' many people', u' more wondrous']",1,[u' terrible food'],-1

i enjoyed an orange shandy (btw secret tip i learned from my 'dragging here' companion, add a shot of peach schnapps to a orange shandy and hello delicious!) and my cajun chicken sandwich. very much in fact; i highly recommend ordering it. nice kick, perfectly cooked chicken breast, lots of crispy shoestring fries.

kHpXJ2vciumu2KhNHg0hYA,"So I know Abu J. has given me the advice to stop going out with losers, and I have yet to take him up on his advice, but after my latest outing I think I will have to.  I was hanging out at home when I got the call to hang out with this guy for a low key night.  I had to remind him it was Monday Night Football and the NLDS game of Phillies v. Rockies.  So he suggests we hit up Majerle's, which I'm down for because it means more sport watching and less talking.

So I find my way down here, and say screw it to paying for parking.  After the whole $20 to park at Westgate, I'm down to take my chances at getting a parking ticket.  It's ridiculous how much the city makes off of parking, parking tickets, and the ever illustrious DUIs.

Anyways, I go into Majerle's, completely ignored by the hostess out front.  Glad to know she's getting paid $8.50 to not talk to anyone and act pretty...  Settle down at the bar and order a Blue Moon, because it's a Monday, it's football, it's baseball, and I'm preparing for another laborious date.

Halfway through my beer my date arrives.  Which wouldn't be cool, but I need to get good and drunk so I deal.  He automatically decides we need to get wings.  Thanks for deciding...because I have no thoughts of my own.  Apparently him being a gentleman meant he would talk shit on the wings I wanted, then reluctantly give in to getting the boneless buffalo wings.  Which are $5 along with four other appetizers during their 4-8 pm happy hour.  Good deal there!

The wings come out within 15 minutes or so and they look...odd.  It looks like someone sliced tofu and lightly fried them, then dipped them in excessive amounts of sauce.  Definitely not the most appetizing item to look at.  I wished they looked better, because then I wouldn't have the hippie making fun of me the whole time.  They tasted okay, but the look alone was too much of a turn off to enjoy.

The bartender disappeared after we ordered the wings, so we spent some time waiting for her to discover us again so we could order our entree.  Oh how I wished she had taken our order earlier.  I had to listen to the douche hippie talk smack on the Angels and how people die all the time so Adenhart's death didn't matter.  Yeah...that deserved a total smack in the face.  Or complete beat down.  Don't ever hate of my Angels or commit blasphemy against Adenhart.  I will not stand for that, especially if I've had a few drinks in me.

Anyways, so I eventually order the veggie wrap with chicken and he gets the chicken parmesan.  Not too much time passes, so I could enjoy the flat screens and watch the Dolphins show Mark Sanchez how to play a real football game.  The wrap comes, and it's huge!  I enjoyed the fruit salad of pineapple and grapes.  And the actually spinach tortilla and veggies were good, but the chicken just dragged the wrap down.  It was so bland and tasteless.  I wish I would have just gone pure veggie.

I had a couple rounds of beer after that, just to pass the time until the Dolphins could be declared the official winners.  Conversation came and went with the people at the bar, far more interesting than the person I was with.  The beers came and went, and soon it was time to peace out.  When I saw the tab, I was glad I didn't have to pay.  $60+ to ""enjoy"" conversation with a tool and overpriced food and drinks.

This one was built in the late 1800s and is one of the oldest still standing in Phoenix. Majerle's has been in the building since 1992, and that is impressive. Let's be honest, downtown Phoenix kinda really sucked in the early 90s. That they have managed to stay open for almost 20 years gets bonus points in my book. 

I had the BBQ chicken wrap, some mild wings, and a beer. (Well, I split it with someone, I am watching my figure.) I liked it. I liked it more than I thought I would since it's a sports bar.

Beer on tap selection is meh.. but I've learned to not expect much from sports bars.

The wing secret sauce is a MUST-HAVE. It's the perfect amount of spicy and sweet.

Here's what we ordered and how it was:

Rojo Diablo - it's fried chicken breast dipped in the special wing sauce and mozzarella is added. The flavors were all there! The bread is mildly sweet which was a nice touch. The chicken was a bit a dry but I ordered wing sauce on the side which helped.

Sweet potato fries - If you like sweet potato fries, these will do the job. Nothing to crazy, just your average sweet potato fries.

Gorilla Wings in Mild - think Native Newyorker Wings. This is the quality. It does the job and is much better than the Hooters down the street

Gorilla Wings in Secret Sauce - DO IT.

Fries - If you're not a shoestring fries fan, then don't get them! They are just your basic shoestring fries.

Fish Tacos - I didn't try them but was told they did a great job.

Potato Skins - Good!

Cheese Fries - They're basically fries with cheese melted on top.  Sooo yeah. They're good though! At least it's not processed cheese. 

It's bar food. So expect bar food quality. It's a great place to watch the game. Some of the loudest most active fans come to this location so be forewarned.

First I totally agree with previous reviews that complain about the location of the TVs. They are in such awkward spots and are only tuned to like two different things, which is semi-annoying. However I can't complain too much when one of them is tuned to Sportscenter which is all I really need as I eat my lunch. My major complaint about Majerle's is that it is a very awkward space. There is a hostess stand out front on the sidewalk but no one is ever there, so you have to walk in and then BAM you are like on top of the bar. So you're in the way while waiting for a hostess which I hate.

Other than that main complaint, I'm not going to hate too much on the food. It's a freaking sports bar. They serve sports bar food. I am not expecting five star cuisine...I just fried goodness that will clog up my ateries and beer on tap. If they have a salad or two so I can feel better about myself, great. For the most part everything I have tried has been good, including the potato skins, grilled chicken caesar wrap, fried chicken salad, kids grilled cheese meal (hey I wasn't hungry that day!) and the house salad. The french fries are really good especially dipped in ranch. The only thing I didn't really like that I have tried has been the chicken tenders. Something about them was just a bit off to me.

Both my drinks and food were a little disappointing; the cocktails were served with little pour, they were so weak that I felt I was drinking lemonade. Then I ordered the Majerle's wings which were cold so I had to ask the waited to place them in a box to take home. I left a little disappointed and that's a bummer because Majerle was one of my childhood idols due to his golden years in Phoenix. Unluckily, the restaurant did not remind me of Majerle's great years in Phoenix, it reminded me of Majerle's performance in 2001 when he was about to retire.",2,"[u' huge screens', u' good place', u' golden years', u' great years']",2.2,"[u' very casual', u' little pour', u' so weak']",-1.2125

kHpXJ2vciumu2KhNHg0hYA,"Located within walking distance of Bank One Ballpark (MLB's Diamondbacks) and US Airways Center (NBA's Phoenix Suns) Majerle's (owned by three-time NBA all-star and local icon Dan Majerle) is a great place to go before and after a game. 

Weekend afternoons--game day or not--are relatively quiet, which means quick service and an attentive wait staff.  And while the food is typical of most sports grills (burgers, sandwiches, and fried appetizers, for example), it's a great place to unwind or to escape the Phoenix heat.  There are the requisite large televisions tuned to the day's sporting events and plenty of memorabilia lining the walls.  Despite these sports bar staples, the place is actually quite cozy and quaint.

But while Majerle's is good in the afternoons, it absolutely rocks after Suns or D-Backs games.  The place is typically packed and it's not uncommon to find local or visiting athletes sipping beers on the narrow sidewalk patio.  The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).

kHpXJ2vciumu2KhNHg0hYA,"Hello Yelp Family,

I would like to share the experience I had at Majerle's Downtown Phoenix.
My girlfriend and I attended their MLK event held on Saturday, January 14, 2012. My first issue with this establishment was the parking or lack thereof. Now I am new here to Phoenix from California and I am familiar with dining downtown. However, most establishments will validate your parking if they do not provide parking and your only option is to use the parking garage. I paid $12 to park in the parking garbage situated adjacent to Merle's and was advised upon arrival that they do not validate parking. I was also advised that the entrance for the MLK celebration was a block down on Washington??? That was a little weird for me especially during a MLK celebration....what are we in the 50's where blacks enter from the back???? That did not sit well with me. Another  issues I had with this place was the DJ. He came over and introduced himself as the DJ from Chicago. He was by far the worst DJ I have ever heard. The music was from one extreme to the other. There was skipping and long pauses between songs. I think Connor Cruise (Tom Cruise's son) would have done a better job. Lastly, the drinks were watered down. It was the first time I had a long island ice tea, that actually taste like ice tea with no alcohol. I will give Majerle's 2 stars. One because the food looked appetizing, although I didn't eat anything and one star because it was the first time since I've lived in Phoenix, that I encounter other black professionals over 30. I am still looking for a place where upscale professional black people over 30 mingle.",2,[],0,"[u' little weird', u' black professionals', u' black people']",-0.677083333

We were fortunate enough to get a couple barstools as there was some convention in town and it appeared everybody was flocking here.  The bartenders were great.  We never ran dry on drinks and were able to get some good wings on happy hour.  We tried boneless wings and their ""Gorilla Wings"".  The boneless wings were great but we were not a fan of the Gorilla Wings by any means.  They were tough and not very tasty.  It was almost is if we were eating deer jerky.  But the boneless wings were great.  

The vibe in here is what made it fun.  There were a lot of Golden State fans a lot of Cavs fans.  There was a lot of cheering and booing going on but not in a hostile way.  It was  good time.

kHpXJ2vciumu2KhNHg0hYA,"My pub crawl compadres and I stopped at Majerle's after having a brief but terrible experience at Networks. I was definitely impressed by the modern stylings and decor. To give Majerle's some credit, they did actually honor their agreement to participate in the pub crawl, offering a drink special, but it turns out that the disgustingly sweet $3 Stoli strawberry lemonades were available to everyone. There were also no food samples. Why did we buy pub crawl wristbands again? 

We attempted to make up for the slowly-worsening pub crawl experience by ordering vodka shots. There was some miscommunication between the bartenders because when the girl we ordered them from disappeared and another bartender approached us to ask if we needed help, we somehow ended up with two rounds of shots. Naturally, we didn't want to pay for both, a statement that got us quite a bit of attitude from the bartenders. The mistake wasn't entirely their fault (we could have been clearer, I supposed), but I could have done without the 'tude, especially since you can just pour vodka back into a bottle. No harm, no foul, right?

That's right, you heard me, Hip Hop Karaoke.  It was awesome.  Walked in with a big group after the Suns game, and it was packed.  Even so, the hostesses went out of their way to find a bunch of open tables and pushed them together for us.

Service wasn't nearly as quick as I'd like, but I try to be realistic.  When you're in a crowded sports bar right after a local sporting event, it's gonna take a few minutes to get your drinks, and I'm cool with that.

After people had a couple of drinks and loosened up, the karaoke lineup was classic!!  It started off with a tiny girl singing Gin and Juice by Snoop Dogg.  Then came the Beastie Boys and Salt N Pepa.  And that was enough, I was hooked!

In the business of full disclosure, I don't think it's advertised as Hip Hop Karaoke, I think it's just referred to as karaoke.  That's just what it's become known as between me and my friends because that's all we've ever heard/sang there.  Which is awesome if you've never experienced it.

Dan Majerle and a few of the Suns rolled there after the game too which was kind of cool, added another fun dynamic to the drunken sing a long.

I love Ruben sandwiches.  I try them almost every place I go to that serves them.  The one I got at Majerle's was not good.  Not good at all.  I've had hundreds of Rubens, and this one had some very weird, off-tasting spice in it that should not EVER be in a Ruben.  I still can't put my finger on what it was, but I've never tasted it in a Ruben sandwich before and hope I never do again.

The soda I ordered tasted like all carbonation and not much syrup.  Reminded me of Alka-Seltzer.

Positive: the bacon on my burger was AMAZING!!!, the fries were crisp fresh hot and they gave you a lot of them, the staff was super nice, we could sit where ever we wanted (but there wasn't many people there yet), they had a good variety of things on their menu and drink menu, they had pretty good drinks specials. the au jus for the french dip was tasty, my step dad recommends the reuben and my mom agreed (I didn't taste it because I dont eat sauerkraut) 

Negative: the cheese fries stunk... I think it was the cheese they used (a kind of cheddar) but I wished I had just got regular fries after they came, the cheese crisp was over cooked and cold, my mom did not like the sandwich part of her french dip (just too boring and she even added mushrooms and onions), and the prices were well kind of over priced (I didn't think my burger was worth 9 bucks)

I really covet being wowed, I like being pleasantly surprised, and I can have a perfectly merry day with a run of the mill meal. Unfortunately, there are some experiences that don't fit in to any of my ""I will return again and again or at least recommend to friends"" template.
 
 Majerle's is one of those experiences.

I know that I should definitely give this place another try but only because I had such a bad time I think that it must have been entirely abnormal because it would be out of business if it was run this way daily.
 When I arrived on Sunday afternoon (right as the Cardinals game was about to start), there were several content tables already enjoying their beer and bar fare. I must say that the food wasn't terrible. I wouldn't classify it as anything special or something that I would crave on any particular day. But the wings were crisp, the salad was fresh'ish' and the burger was prepared to the temp I ordered. This is where the one star came from. Decent food (good temp, tastes like what it's supposed to, sans hair, ect) deserves some credit.
 
   If I could give negative stars for service, this would be a -5 Stars type of place. Our server was either hung over or was just entirely uninterested in doing ANYTHING that her job description calls for. She greeted us about ten minutes after we sat down (although it was a Cardinals game day, the bar was probably about half full). She took our drink order and returned with our drinks ages later (well, another almost ten minutes). I was starving and ready to order food but wasn't able to because she slammed the drinks on the table and left again. I flagged down another server and he was so kind as to send ours back. FINALLY I ordered. Again, the food was fine. It wasn't, however, fine enough to cancel out the fact that our appetizer was delivered 20 minutes laster followed IMMEDIATELY by our entree's. Ok. Fine. But, the salad was wrong the first time (Note: When your guests are ordering, it helps to listen to what they actually want. It is NOT a good practice to forget and then just 'guess' what they said). And our server didn't even deliver our food so we couldn't order another drink until we flagged her down again. We ordered another two beers and waited. And waited. And waited. I saw our beers sitting on the bar and our server chatting in the corner to another associate. We couldn't get her attention so my dining companion/boyfriend went to the bar himself to get them. In fact, we didn't see our server again for the rest of the meal. I was so irate at this point that I wanted to leave immediately and spend our Sunday afternoon football watching/beer drinking pennies elsewhere. I flagged down the same server I asked to find my server the first time and had him do my bidding again (he seemed to be working, why couldn't I have sat in HIS section?) She came over, mumbled some apology about having to get our own beers and dropped our check. 
  Bright points: They have a great tv set up for football watching. Multiple tv's tuned to every single game you could imagine. 
Not so Bright Points: For me, watching football at a sports bar has necessary accoutrements (steady flow of beer, timely delivery of food, ect) to make it enjoyable. This mark was completely missed due entirely to the complete disregard our server had for her job. Or her guests.
Downright Dim points: Well, this review pretty much sums it up.

Such was the case last night at Majerle's, former Phoenix Suns player Dan Marjerle's sports bar. With the Beyonce concert across the street at the arena AND a D-backs game at the ball park, Phoenix was a hoppin'.

My friend and I stopped into Majerle's, which I've been to a few times before, for dinner and drinks before going to see Beyonce. I had a cheeseburger and Cesar Salad. While I realize it's hard to mess up a Cesar Salad, my salad was seriously the best Cesar I've ever had. And my burger was packed with flavor. No wonder AOL  named them Best Burgers two years in a row. We also had a wonderful chocolate martini (with Vanilla Vodka, not creme based) here. And on Fridays if you're in the mood to really start the night, the bar offers a Corona or Pacifico with a shot of tequila for $7 as part of their Sizzlin' Friday special.

My only complaint was that our waitress suddenly went M.I.A for about 15 minutes when we were trying to close our tab so we could go to the show.  But I'm still going to cut them some slack because this is one of a few fun places to drink in the downtown area.

Everything there could use a lot of improvement. Upon arriving we were greeted by a hostess who seemed to be confused about where to seat us, although the restaurant was mostly unoccupied, with the exception of the small bar area. This led to her being bickered at by what ended up being our waitress. We were then seated by the manager with no menus. I went to the ladies room to wash my hands before our meal, where I was enjoying the lovely music.... just as it was abrubtly turned off. There was no music for the rest of our visit. When we finally got some menus (and bread upon request), we ordered some drinks. I ordered a rum and coke, and my date ordered a coffee. Don't let their happy hour advertising fool you! There is NO HAPPY HOUR at Ruffino's restaurant. Although they do have a happy hour in the small bar area, if you sit even 10 feet away from it, you do not get to enjoy the special drink prices. I was misled and ended up paying full price for a drink, that if ordered a few feet away would have been half price! My date's coffee came out lukewarm, and when our appetizers arrived I had wished I ordered something else. My dates salad was pretty tasty, but my tortellini en brodo soup was awful. It was some chicken bouillon water with overcooked pasta, that had no hint of the meat it had suggested existed in it. Our entrees arrived quite a while later, and our table still hadn't been bussed since the appetizers. Both of our entrees were pretty darn tasty, but both were only lukewarm again. Not hot at all. Then there was a baby screaming with no music playing to distract me from the wailing infant. The waitress was snippy and seemed to be in a bad mood. And even with a lady following the waitress around for training, couldn't seem to bring out a box for my food and a requested cup of coffee. The service was just slow and almost snotty. So, I really wouldn't recommend it. It is too overpriced for a place with a hit and miss menu and very poor service.
Also, I ordered the Chicken Florentine, which is supposedly a stuffed chicken breast. But, it was actually only just topped with the ingredients listed. It also doesn't come with a knife, so I had to attempt cutting it up with a butter knife.

Our plan was to order a glass of wine & Oysters Rockefeller, and we did. Teresa, whom I believe is the owner, was working the bar and looked like kitchen help. Her black outfit (uniform) was very unattractive and it looked like she'd been cleaning a house all day long. You would think she would look nice since she's serving the guests. The restrooms were playing wonderful Italian Music, Dean Martin was playing when I was in there, but out in the dining area there was THUMP THUMP music...really? This is an Italian restaurant, where's the ambiance? If I wanted THUMP THUMP/ hip hop, I'd not pick an Italian restaurant. Maybe we should have sat in the bathroom? Oh...but it gets better. A young man, teens, brought in the trash cans from outside, as in 'big round trash bins,' one in each hand, right through the lounge where we were sitting in the booth, one of the trans cans almost rubbed my husband's right arm.  A few minutes later, the young man went out again and brought a 3rd one in, the same way! No lids on the trash cans, just big old dirty trash cans being brought in through the front door - OMG, REALLY? This would break so many regulations - don't ya think? GROSS! How dirty and germy. The wine was just ok, and the Oysters Rockefeller were the worst ever. There were 6, and they were tiny and pathetic looking. They were edible, and we ate them, for $20 - you better believe we ate them, but they are not in any league to even be called Oysters Rockefeller.  My gosh, go to DURANTS and order theirs, THAT'S OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER. Ruffino didn't even have cheese on theirs. The presentation failed drastically. They sat these sad looking 'things' on a wilted bed of iceburg shredded lettuce. You know, the more I think about it, I shouldn't have paid, and I shouldn't have eaten them. We just should have walked out and said ""REALLY?""  I even left a tip, that's how stupid I am. She didn't deserve a tip, because besides the fact the food was a joke, she didn't come by ONCE, to ask how things were. Didn't even ask if we wanted another drink - nothing. We finally had to flag her down for the check. $33 for what? I felt sick when we left there. Oh well, you never know what you're gonna get, right? We went it happy - looking forward to get our Friday on, and left in different spirits. Felt ripped off and very disappointed. I can tell you that 10 years ago this restaurant was the best in town. It's changed hands long since and is not even comparable anymore.  My amazement is, 1.  How can you allow food to leave your kitchen looking as this dish did? No presentation at all?  2. Do you not know what Oysters Rockefeller are? These didn't look or taste like them. Call them baked oysters, or something, but not Rockefeller, c'mon.

cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g,"I haven't had great Italian in way too long. Thank you to the boss man for suggesting this place for our office dinner outing. 

Everything was great with Ruffino's, right from the start, from making easy reservations on their web page, to the call back confirming our reservation, to seating us right on time.

We started in the bar area for a drink before we sat down, the cocktail server was very nice and got our drinks quickly, you know we needed them after meetings all day. From then on all was great; Our server, John I think, was very nice and made great suggestions, the manager was around a few times to make sure everything went well. 

Some of the guys at the table wanted to order a few appetizers, muscles and escargot. Oh dear lord they are going to make me eat snails I thought to myself. And to my great surprise, they were great. I have never had them before, and from my understanding, they are only good if made right, and made right these were. Very yummy, i will have them again for sure. 

For dinner I had the Shrimp Carbenara, suggested by John, and it was awesome! Very tasty, huge portion, and a great leftover meal for the next day. 

Ruffino's has been around for a long time from my understanding, and I can clearly see why, great service, great food, great time!",4,"[u' easy reservations', u' very nice', u' very nice', u' great suggestions', u' sure everything', u' great surprise', u' only good', u' huge portion', u' great leftover', u' great service', u' great food', u' great time']",8.043333333,[],0
cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g,"I had not realized Ruffino's Italian Cuisine was under new management of Trattoria D'Amico until I arrived at the restaurant until I arrived at in the parking lot.  My story is as follows:

Tonight we made reservations for four at Ruffino's Italian Cuisine -- one of my favorite restaurants for years.  It is a classical family run Italian restaurant where you always felt welcomed.  The owner typically greeted at the door and chatted with you on the way out.  If there were ever an issue, it was taken care of immediately, with the owner always involved, and you were very satisfied when you left.  Times have changed...

Now when you pull up to the restaurant the first thing you see is a large white sign covering the business name indicating under new management.  The restaurant is now named ""Trattoria D'Amico, Ruffino Cucina Italiana"". Inside nothing has changed, no remodeling, same bar, same tables, and everything in the original positions.  Had it not been for the sign, you wouldn't know it was under new  management.   

The next thing you realize there is no friendly greeter.  No one with that friendly smile who seems more interested in you, than selling you a meal.  My new impression upon entering is that it has the feel of a chain store restaurant with a minimal wage worker just interested in doing their job of getting you seated.  

The restaurant was about half-full leaving many empty tables.  We were escorted to a very small table and I asked to be moved to a larger one.  This seemed to be a problem.  Finally they moved us to the same-size table in a slightly larger space so we didn't feel so cramped.  I noted through the entire dinner that the larger tables were never used and that the dining room never filled.

After waiting an unusually long time, someone dropped of a basket of bread, saying she noted we had been waiting a while -- someone would be with us soon.  We were told Izzy would be waiting on us (whom never seemed to have showed up).  After another extended wait a different waiter came to the table and said he would be our server (I don't know what happen to Izzy).  

The hostess had only given us 2 menus (we had to ask for more).   We ordered some wine and asked for some more bread (I hadn't had any the first round).  Again, another long wait for the wine to be served by a third person.  Still waiting even longer, the waiter finally returned to take our orders.  

The two ladies had the special for the evening (salmon) while my friend chose the chicken and I asked for Rigatoni Parm with Marinara.  I reminded the waiter for a second time that we needed more bread.    

After the usual wait, the meal was delivered.  The ladies served first, then my friend.  I was given the wrong meal.  The waiter said he would have it corrected and I reminded him one more time we needed more bread.   

I sat there and waited, waited, and waited....   No bread delivered, no one check on us for more drinks, as I watched everyone at the table finish their meals.  I saw the waiter a few times, but he never gazed over at our table.  Finally, when diner was complete, I caught his attention and he came over.  I asked him to cancel my order.  He responded ""I think it is ready"" and headed to the kitchen.  He immediately returned with it, and I reminded him that we needed more bread.  Another person brought that over.  

My friends at the table were very gracious, encouraging me now to rush dinner, as they sensed the awkwardness.  I took my first bite an the meal was barely warm.  It had obviously sat ready for a while.

After all this, not even a manager visited our table to check on us -- and we were billed the full amount.  

At no point was was their an apology for the bad service or the mistake.  I did hear a comment on how the restaurant was being slammed as I looked at the empty tables around me.

For the price of the meal, this is not the ambiance more service level I would expect.  It felt more like a Denny's...    

In the past, the kindly owner always stood by the door checking in on how the meal was, and offering some small chit-chat.  The only thing at the door was a small dish of mints.

Unfortunately Rufino's has gone from my favorite restaurant to one that I will not visit again.",1,"[u' favorite restaurants', u' very satisfied', u' original positions', u' friendly greeter', u' more interested', u' more bread', u' more bread', u' more bread', u' barely warm', u' full amount', u' favorite restaurant']",5.225,"[u' minimal wage', u' empty tables', u' very small', u' wrong meal', u' bad service', u' empty tables', u' small chit-chat', u' small dish']",-2.325

We have been going to Ruffino's for over 20 years, off and on, and still like it.  I am writing this review just to give readers some recent feedback.  Ruffino has a limited menu, but pretty decent food and prices.  Nothing outstanding, but decent and worth your time if you want to try their offerings.  My wife ordered their clam linuini, lunch portion, and it was good and substantial.  My daughter ordered the lunch manicotti and that too was decent and substantial.  Lunch does not come with anything -- no veggie, no salad -- just the entree and bread.  I ordered the dinner order of veal masala and it was good and came with veggies, side pasta, and side salad.  The price was fair.  We ordered and shared an antipasti platter to share first, and it came with two kinds of cheese, two kinds of olives, artichoke hearts, ham, procuitto, salami, mortadella, sweet and hot peppers, and about four big leaves of romaine.  Pretty substantial.  So I just wanted to report that it was pretty good and we will go back, but next time on a Thurs, since Thurs is Osso Bucco day.",4,"[u' pretty decent', u' hot peppers', u' pretty good']",0.933333333,[u' late lunch'],-0.3

First of all, even though our table was close to the door in the bar area, the host did not even accompany us, but motioned where to sit. Upon ordering our drinks, we were very surprised being told there would be an extra charge for stuffed olives in my husband's martini. My husband has ordered martinis with stuffed olives at the most finest, and least popular restaurants, and never has he been told an additional cost would be charged for his request. Consequently, after waiting an unusually long time for our before dinner drinks, they were brought to our table along with my husband's soup. In the past we had often frequented Ruffino's, however with the present ownership we are likely not to return. Food was just o.k., nothing exceptional. I think Ruffino's had lost its personal flavor as the previous owners would drop by the table, ask if service and food were enjoyable and to our liking, chatted a little, and made you feel like special guests.

The food was generally pretty good,  but could have been warmer.  The service was another story. Initial drink service was slow. Food service for the appetizers was agonizingly slower.

The manager came over and started to help her, then the waiter came over to serve the last salad.  My salad had lettuce with lots of brown spots.

Appetizers - 

Sauteed Mussels in white garlic sauce.  Spectacular.  Hint - take the garlic bread and dip in in the sauce.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.

Bruscheta - old skool and tasty, the only complaint is that true Italian Bruscheta does not have Balsamic Vinegar drenched on it.  I loved it, the Euro boys did not.

Antipasto Platter - Lots of tasty stuff on this very large plate of goodies.

Soup - Reviews for Lobster Bisque were stellar.  My take - to much cream, not enough lobster chunks, in fact, none.  Tasted like cream soup.  Just not for me, I would rate in 2 stars or 5 out of 10, mediocre.

Dinner (we shared)

Veal Parmigiana - About an 7 out of 10, kind of no flavor.  Decent but not the best I have had.  Served with grill veggies, which were excellent.

Seafood Ruffino - 10 out of 10.  Just plain to die for.  Lives up to my fellow Yelpers recommendations.

The only thing worse than the ambience is the food. The Italian food served at Trattoria D'Amico like most Chandler area establishments is amateur Italian. This is the worst of the lot. 

Food lacks in flavor(tasteless and signs of a home schooled completely out of his league), presentation(pasta was scooped into a bowl and placed upside down on serving plate, I don't even plate food like that at home not to mention lack of garnishing) freshness and quality of ingredients(lots of pre-prepped food why not just go to the frozen food section of your local super market). Prices were outrageously priced given the quality of food. Any Italian restaurants bread and butter is a bolognese sauce. If you can't get that right, you're in trouble.

The service was also excellent.  Our waiter was hyper animated which was a little annoying yet appreciated because he was attentive.  Overall the service was nearly perfect. All the waiters had manners and were old school in their mannerism. Again, this was a welcome change from the trendy young stud or hot girl who act like they are too cool to be serving tables. 

In regards to the food....DISAPPOINTING.  I was really shocked. I really wanted to like this place but the food had no flavor.  There is nothing about the food that would make one want to go back.  The eggplant parmegan was sloppy and watery egglant that tasted like boiled egglant.  The tortalleni ruffino was served in an alfredo sauce that tasted like potato soup poured onto pasta. It was so thick and tasteless. The tortelini had no flavor and it's filling was bland. 

The restaurant does some things to provide one with a homely feel. They serve garlic bread toasts as free appetizers and constantly refresh it. The jazz music in the background was also a nice touch.

However, we had a bad experience on Mother's Day and I wrote a note to the management and still haven't received a response. The service was beyond terrible that day and the place was packed because of a huge first communion party. There was a table of 10 unsupervised children right by us that were loud. The adults were sitting a few tables away and basically ignored them until it came time to serve cake. We asked the manager to do something and were ignored. There were issues with our order, slow service and an unpleasant experience. This saddens me because they have great food, but the service and execution just isn't there.

The restaurant really doesn't look like a whole lot from the outside.  It is in a small strip mall nestled between a Dry Cleaner and a shoe repair shop.  On the inside it is a little dated, but the service and food more than make up for it.

When it comes to service, the wait staff is always extremely attentive.  The owner, Steve, is also great.  He is very hands on and always quick to address any concerns that may arise.   When we had our rehearsal dinner here, he helped come up with a custom menu and pricing instead of their typical event menu.

The food is amazing.  The mean starts out with fresh garlic bread that is out of this world.  For the entrée, my wife and I are extremely fond of the Filet Mignon, which is always cooked perfectly and extremely tender.  Their other entrees, like the chicken parmigiana, are also delicious.

As I wrote above, the service is excellent and the food great (a little pricy, but if you want value go to Olive Garden).

cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g,"Ruffino was the first restaurant my family ate at when we moved to Arizona, which means that simple math would suggest I've been eating here for sixteen years! Seriously. I've eaten here several times a year for sixteen years and have been through either two or three owner changes. I love it. From the mildly cheesy, somewhat 80s styling to the tuxedo'd out waiters, I can't get enough. Ruffinos is a classy restaurant where you're more than some random customer and through my years here, the management has practically bent backwards at times to make things right. 
The food here is incredible, and if you're lucky enough to come on a night they have osso bucco, you'll be stuck coming back for the next sixteen years like me. I can vouch for so many of the food items here, but I'll just make a couple of suggestions. For starters the clams casino and escargot can't be beat, they are both rich and garlicky and the escargot is simply not as chewy as most places, so good. For your meal try the tortellini ruffino, one of my favorite meals of all time, or the veal ruffino or filet medallions if they have them. But the osso bucco is a step above most things I've tried in my life. Expensive and worth it.

cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g,"2.5 stars, maybe.  I hate to bag on a restaurant because I know restaurant owners work so hard, but this was a pretty bad experience.  I know they have live music, too, and that is a sign of class.

Fundamentally, the problem with this place can best be summed up by saying that it wouldn't surprise me if there isn't a single Italian involved in the running of this place.  If there is, they have gone so American it's hard to tell.  Think Pascal in ""Big NIght.""

When I showed up by myself at 7pm, I had not eaten lunch so I should have been pretty easy to please.  The restaurant was mostly empty, yet I was sat  at a small table right next to the only baby in the restaurant.  Really?  I probably didn't look Awhatukee chic, but I didn't look like a bum either.  And hey, it was Monday and my credit card is paid off.

I was sat by the owner (I think).  He didn't take a drink order and then I waited a long time to get a menu or a drink.  I don't blame the server.  It was bad timing as she knew she had a meal for four being plated and a couple of credit cards to run.  The owner could have easily handled both the menu and my drink order.

Then, they brought the garlic bread.  It was that soggy over-buttered, undercooked, nastiness you would never get in Italy or even a high-end Italian restaurant in the states.  (Think Fazoli's)  The greasiness probably started to take away my appetite which had been sky high when I arrived.  I would strongly recommend that Ruffino's ditch the garlic bread and go with nice Italian bread and small bowl of butter.

Soon after, the entrees for the neighboring table arrived.  They didn't look like $25-30 entrees.  Even the osso bucco looked unappetizing..

Then, they brought me a cup of brodo with tortellini.  The waitress warned me to be careful because it was super hot.  I would say it was just hot enough not to get sent back.  It was decent, but kind of puny for four bucks.  The bowl would have been seven and I was mostly trying it out of curiosity.  The broth was pretty good, but as it got colder it lost any magic it had.

I also got a Campari and soda, which was a little light on Campari.  It didn't come with a fruit wedge of any type, which is pretty standard when an Italian is behind the bar.  So, I asked for an orange.  Unfortunately, because I was seated in the farthest corner from the door and the bar, I didn't get the orange until I was over halfway through the Campari and soda.  Maybe I'm off base here and I should asked for it explicitly.  Sorry, I'm not much of a drinker.

The salad was quite good.  They make it tableside which is nice because I got to pick my choice of elements.  The greens were excellent and the dressing was nice.  I think I got two portions even though I was by myself, which was great.  Unfortunately, there was a little too much cheese (or something) making it too heavy.  Still, not bad.

Throughout the evening my water glass was empty, which is annoying when you're paying $20 minimum for an entree.  I'm not a stickler about this stuff, but when it happens 3-5 times at a place like this, it's not right.  My waitress was very nice and worked very hard.  One thing that sort of stuck with me was when I was discussing the menu, she said something like, ""They've been here 20 years, it's good.""  I'm wondering if that was indicative of a place resting too much on its laurels.

I got the Fettuccini Ruffino which was a sausage-based dish listed as one of seven signature dishes on the menu and strongly recommended by my server because it was ""simple"" and tasty.  After a pretty dubious performance so far, I convinced myself that this entree was going to hit it out of the park and save the evening.  Instead, it was a total failure and I was actually forcing it down by the end.  It wasn't simple.  It was sloppy.

They cooked the life out of the fettuccini and the sauce looked like something Olive Garden would have invented, not like the sausage crumbles with oil, pasta and vegetables I am used to at high-end Italian joints.  The sausage was exactly like something you'd buy at Trader Joe's, which isn't bad, but it didn't seem homemade or special.  Honestly, if they had put the plate in front of me, my first reaction would have been to tell them they had brought it to the wrong table.   Maybe I was expecting the wrong the thing, but whatever the case, it didn't taste very good.

Afterward, I went to Enzo's Cafe and Gelato for a cappuccino to make things right.  There was more Italian in that cappuccino than a whole meal at Ruffino's.  Now, I'm watching Tony Bourdain in Naples just to make up for the rest of the evening..

I hope I can get another chance to go here and have them prove me wrong, but I won't do it on my dime.  There was just a little too much Olive Garden in Ruffino's to justify the prices.",2,"[u' pretty easy', u' just hot', u' pretty good', u' quite good', u' not bad', u' very nice', u' pretty dubious', u"" n't bad"", u' very good']",4.406666667,"[u' so hard', u' bad experience', u' mostly empty', u' small table', u' bad timing', u' small bowl', u' too heavy', u' not right', u' total failure', u' wrong table']",-3.292857143

Anyways, we started off with fried calamari and it was a huge appetizer. The batter on the calamari was very light and cooked just right. I thought it was really good. Also, they gave us little pieces of garlic bread. Outstanding. Really good. Everyone gobbled it up so we had to get another basket. 

So each meal comes with soup or salad. I got the salad and I thought it was really big dinner salad it had mixed greens with cucumber, mushrooms, and tomatoes. The salad dressing was great. Not overpowering because at some places the vinegar is a little too much. Not here. Really good. 

I had the Seafood Ruffino. It had shrimp, scallops, muscles, and clams over a bed to pasta with a red sauce. I thought it was pretty good. I thought the red sauce could have tasted a little better.

cpkBJhBujpBFZ0rOItE-4g,"Amateur Hour: How Dinner Could Have Gone Terribly Wrong But Somehow Ended Up Being Rock Solid

The setting: New Year's Eve, six o'clock, South Tempe and Ahwatukee
The players: The ravenous Mr. Man and Me, a Black Mitsubishi Montero on a mission

Granted, going out for dinner on New Year's Eve is by and large a mistake. Holidays are the times when it's most likely the stresses placed on the kitchen and wait staff may result in frazzled service and a less than savory dining experience. But ramen for dinner was out of the question. (I've tried to keep that survival food to a minimum since graduating.) So what's a gal to do? 

Hop into the hooptyville and cruise in search of something better than soggy shoestrings. Doesn't sound like much of a challenge at first until our two players realize that it's New Year's Even and they're pretty fucked for A) Places that still have seats open cuz all the smart folks made reservations, B) Places that are open at all cuz nobody wants to work when there's bubbly to be had and C) Places other than 24 hour greasy spoons cuz even fast food joints close on New Year's Eve.

45 minutes elapse in which our players dart in and out of establishments encountering option A, drive by potential restaurants while encountering option B, and almost succumb to option C. Enter Ruffino's, a humble little Italian Restaurant located in a strip mall dangerously close to the suburbs of Ahwatukee. 

So we saunter up and politely wait our turn for the hostess to be free. ""Two. No, we didn't make reservations."" And the flibbertigibbet proceeds to seat two parties milling around us without even informing us whether dining there was a possibility. Again, she turns to us. ""Do you have an open table for two? No, we didn't make reservations."" Again, she proceeds to seat others. Lots and lots of others.

Oh no you did not just rouse the bitch from her slumber. The pursed lips, raised eyebrow and death stare begin to surface. Mr. Man senses the subtle change, ""Do you just want to go and find somewhere else to eat?""

A cold, calculating response with an edge sharp enough to cut the horrid poodle hair off the twit that's been snubbing us spews out. (I can't recall what it was exactly. The vitriol clouds memory, often with good reason.)

Then our savior, a tux dressed waiter out of stage left, greets us with a smile and ushers us to a table for two in the bar area. The bitch circles three times before settling down for a snooze so Erica can enjoy a nice meal with Mr. Man.

Since it was a busy holiday they only had three seating times and a truncated menu, but that just makes it easier for an indecisive gal like me to make up my mind. Mr. Man goes with his favorite, the Veal Marsala. I opt for the Veal Ruffino, prosciutto and mushrooms sauteed in a tarragon brandy cream sauce layered over veal medallions. Yes I eat poor caged baby cows. And I do it because they taste goooooood. My meal was perfection, with a side of al dente rigatoni in marinara and perfectly steamed petite julienne vegetables. The marsala wasn't as stellar, but I'm not the one that had to consume it, so to each their own. 

The meal came with garlic bread, which was respectable, and a salad that was delish! Their house vinagrette was rockin'. We also decided to kick off the evening with a bottle of chardonnay that was chilled in one of them thingys that stands by your table. 

There were balloons and streamers and live entertainment in the form of a super stellar, pitch perfect showman all tuxed out and belting out classics while playing the piano. Cutesy couples were even requesting songs and dancing with their sweeties. Aww. The sap in me just melts. See that puddle of goo at your feet? That's me. Don't step in it.

There was also a nice program they were running that night where they would take you home for a flat rate of 10 bucks within a 15 mile radius so you didn't ring in the New Year with a DUI. Now that's class.

I don't know if I'd ever go back here again (leetle on the pricey side at 20-30 bucks for an entree) but if you're in the area and looking for a dining experience rather than straight calories, hit it up!",4,"[u' smart folks', u' good reason', u' nice meal', u' nice program']",2.114285714,[u' subtle change'],-0.333333333

I made reservations several days in advance for my daughters 18th Birthday and from the moment we arrived the service was horrible. Waited at the doorway for several minutes before being greeted and then a waiter took us to our table. No warm greeting for us! The table was horrific ...in the absolute worse location in a busy isle right by  kitchen doorway. When I asked if we could be seated somewhere else & that I had made reservations several days ago, the waiter was quite rude and stated that they were very busy and everyone else had made reservations as well. He finally offered another location but stated it would be just as bad.  We just sat where we were.   (Btw, half the restaurant was empty) Several times staff ran into the back of my chair and not once did they say excuse me. 

The service was fair....we had empty water glasses most of the dinner. Waited for a very long time for our food and one meal had been forgotten.  The food was ok-not fabulous. Maybe it was the entire experience.

Once in this small un-assuming place & seeing all the taco choices, I decided to dine in and try some tacos. I ordered two carne asada and two fish tacos. Also got a bottle of Coke to wash it down (I only drink Coke when it's in a bottle, weird!). 

Anyways, loved the basic ness of the place: order, sit down, eat, repeat! Loved the carne asada tacos. The fish tacos were good but a little salty for my taste. I liked that they serve grilled onions & peppers, they were really good. 

Belly full and wondering how I was going to evade another speeding ticket in the great state of Arizona while in a food coma, I hear someone order tamales. I love tamales but was way too full to even think of eating. I ask the owner if they are already warmed up & he informed me that they were cold & I could warm them up in the microwave when I got home, score!

I ordered two spicy chicken tamales and rushed home (going the speed limit of course) & popped them in the microwave for two minutes. DELICIOUS!!! Omg, those were some of the best tamales I've ever had!

The carne asada and fish tacos were awesome! 

The carne asada was lightly seasoned, tender and served the way it should be - straight up on two little corn tortillas,  sprinkled with finely chopped onion and a sprinkling of cilantro. Reminds me of the LA street tacos I miss so much.

The fish taco is also excellent so you've got to try it! They use a light batter, and its quickly fried. So the fish is crisp, tender and flaky on the inside and ohhhh so yummy. They serve it drizzled with a bit of chipotle mayo and some shredded salad. You have to try this!

2Yq-Y-tDroP7mdDfcWJLCQ,"Maybe my expectations were set way too high for this place, due to its universal praise, but I can't help but feel like Tacos Atoyac could be better.  They have some solid tacos, to be sure.  The first thing I noticed, after walking in the door, is that they have a good menu.  Plenty of taco choices, including cabeza, tripa, lengua, and chorizo; quesadillas; an oaxacan hot dog (perro caliente, they call it); and more.  Furthermore, they have a solid selection of Mexican sodas.

So why just three stars?  I've had all of the above items, and none of them really blew me away.  The tacos were good, but I have had better street tacos elsewhere.  These tacos were just a little too high on the grease, and a little low on the flavor.  The tripa tastes a little more burnt than tripa I've had elsewhere; perhaps they fried it too long?  The quesadillas are pretty standard quesadillas (although the asada ones may be worth a shot next time).  The chorizo was... pink?

The hot dog was pretty good, with the black beans, and avocado, so they get points for having a unique item there.  I don't know where else you can get a dog like this.  Unfortunately, I do prefer a Sonoran dog; the Oaxacan dog is a little too light on the heat.

Don't let underwhelming tacos dissuade you from trying this place, though; it's a great place to get some tacos if you're in the area.  It will probably earn a spot in my lunch rotation as long as I'm working in the neighborhood, but you probably don't need to go across town for this.",3,"[u' good menu', u' hot dog', u' more burnt', u' hot dog', u' pretty good', u' unique item', u' too light', u' great place']",3.75,[u' black beans'],-0.166666667

I settled on the spicy burrito and my girlfriend had the fish tacos (she had a couple others too but I forget which ones).

The fish tacos were superb (she let me have a bite).  The others she had also had great flavors.  They were served with a variety of sauces and a side of grilled onions that I believe she said were the best she has had in a very long time.  I tried them and darn it, she was right.  My burrito was a good size and very tasty.  Dan had given me the option of how spicy I wanted it and based on what I told him they nailed it.  It was just enough to make me full but not so much that I went into a food coma.

Overall, the place was very clean and it is not a huge place.  We will definitely be back here and have made it a staple in our places to frequent.  They are not open on Sundays so get your fix in on Saturday if you can't make it during the week.

Food: Utter disappointment. 

The tortillas for our tacos were tough. As a cook, I know this only happens when tortillas are reheated. My wild guess is the cooks heated the tortillas ahead of time for a busy hour and then reheated them once we ordered; second possibility is the tortillas were left unwrapped in the fridge getting a tough edge then were used for customers. This is completely unacceptable.

The carne asada was underwhelming. The horchata had a watered down taste.

I normally don't write too many negative reviews - I like to promote and support  the places I like and leave the ones I don't like out of sight and out of mind - but I just got back from lunch @ Atoyac, and I'm pissed.  All you positive reviewers have let me down big time.  The street tacos had zero flavor and the sauces were lacking in both flavor and kick.  I sampled the chicken, pastor, carne, chorizo, and fish - and they all came up way short.  I'm not going back ever.

It's in an ""edgy"" location, and qualifies as a genuine ""hole-in-the-wall"" joint that people are just aching to love, regardless of the quality of the food.  For whatever reason, people want to love shit holes (BUT THE FOOD IS SOOO GOOD!!) and promote them to their friends.  It's really weird.

You gotta try the al pastor burrito. I say burrito because one taco just won't do it. After you eat one taco you'll want like ten more so just do yourself a favor and order the burrito with extra green sauce. I should have listened to the big guy. 

The two fish tacos were served in one dish and even though I ordered one for me and one for my dad I never got the pleasure of trying that delicious taco treat because my dad ate them both!

2Yq-Y-tDroP7mdDfcWJLCQ,"I just moved to Scottsdale from San Francisco four months ago and I've been pretty disappointed overall with the selection of food and the worst servers in all of the country are found in this entire city. I'm a big food critic and a foodie and I am always searching for the best places anywhere I go.

Since I moved here I've been searching for a really good Mexican place and all of them have left me not even wanting to waste my time writing a review. Many of them are trying to be very 'creative' by adding ingredients that should never even have them to begin with! (i.e., it must be a thing here to have guacamole with craisins or some kind of dried fruit...that is just THE most disgusting thing I've ever had and to be honest I feel bad for these restaurants that do this). 

Tacos Atoyac definitely grabbed my attention. A true hole in the wall place, overall great!

Some of the items may have lacked seasoning, however they don't try to be creative. I do wish they offered a salsa that did have bigger flavor, bolder, and spicier. 

When ordering tacos, they give you a side of 'cebollas ahogadas' which are basically onions sauteed softly which is very authentic from a few regions in Mexico. They could have been sauteed a bit more but still very nicely done.

I heard from the grapevine the tall gentleman at the counter speaks perfect Spanish and seems to me he would be more than gladly to answer any questions you might have on the menu which is very easy and no bullshit either. That's great!

Overall, I would recommend this place and would most definitely come back. It's a bit far a commute for me living in Kierland, but it is definitely worth my gas.

2Yq-Y-tDroP7mdDfcWJLCQ,"We went to Tacos Atoyac for lunch again and really enjoyed the food based on a recommendation from Iain B.  This is not border Mexican food but rather oaxaca or oaxaquena southern Mexico or what you might find in Mexico City.  Their prices are very easy on your pockets, but don't let that fool you.  Their food is extremely fresh, unique and delicious.  What a little ""gem"" of a place this is!  

Restaurant ~ Tacos Atoyac is small and not very appealing on the outside (somewhat of a dive look) but it's what's on the inside that counts and this place is no exception.  This place is very clean with a simple design on the inside. The folks that work here are friendly and will make you feel very welcomed.  This was huge since for us since both of us speak very little Spanish.  

Food ~ You order your food when you walk in and they bring you your delicious oaxacan-Mexican food to you accompanied with a side of cooked jalapenos, onions and salsa (you can choose green, red or a guacamole infused salsa).  The green chili salsa went exceptionally well with my fish and al pastor tacos.  No chips and salsa here, which I'm perfectly fine with.  

On our first visit we sampled all of the tacos at $1 each.  The carne asada and al pastor were tender and delicious with with some chopped cilantro and onions on top. All of the tacos were very good, even the lengua and tripa o cabeza tacos. (yes I knew they were tongue and tripe~ but they were good!) I just added a little salsa which gave it just the right amount of heat to add to the flavor.  We also tried their spicy beef and chicken tamales at $1.75. Thy were very good as well but I preferred their tacos, so went back for few more.  Total bill with a few drinks was around $18 for us both.

Second visit we had their fish tacos ~ they are delish!  We also had a couple of quesadilla's since they were making them fresh from scratch at $1.50. The corn quesadilla was tasty with some fresh green  epazote, cheese and a light spread of frijoles! We also tried their flour quesdilla's and a few burros with al pastor and carne asada.  They too were very good with a nice balance of fresh guacamole and loads of meat in their burros. We sampled a lot of food again this trip and left stuffed and happy with a bill of only $24.
  
We have really enjoyed most of the things we've tried so far and we are looking forward to coming back very soon.  Tacos Atoyac will leave you satisfied, happy and planning what to eat on your next visit.  They keep it simple with tons of flavor.

I especially don't understand any rating drop for aesthetics, the dining area is small and utilitarian, but it's clean and feels surprisingly comfortable.

First and foremost, the guy who manned the register the two times I've visited, which I believe is the owner or part owner evokes images of Paul Bunyan, minus his giant blue ox.  The guy is huge and bearded, but he's one of the most personable and caring people in food service I've ever had the pleasure of interacting with.  You can sense that he genuinely cares and enjoys the company of his customers which immediately invokes the warm-fuzzies.  He'll make suggestions to help you build the most amazing Mexican meal you've ever had.  Trust his direction and you cannot go wrong.

Personal anecdote time:  Today I ordered a spicy burrito.  I wanted it pretty spicy, but not quite as spicy as what I was presented with.  I still managed to wolf down more than half of the burrito and even with the excessive amount of heat, it still tasted amazing.  Eventually it wore me down so I threw in the towel and moved on to the less spicy fare.  In the end I threw out maybe 1/4 of a burrito, if not less.  After I finished eating, I stopped over at the head shop adjacent to his building and get this, the owner ran over after me, slipped me a five, and ran off.  He gave me a refund on a burrito I all but finished eating.  Nearly brought a tear to my eye.

Moving on to the food, I don't think I can write anything that will do it justice.  I'm just not that good of a writer.  Simply put, I've never had Mexican that tasted as good as this.  The concoction the meats are marinaded in is otherwordly.  The tortillas are heavenly.  I'm at a loss for words when trying to describe the food.

The tacos were so small that I could eat one in one bite.  I heard the tortillas come from Ranch Market--not made in the restaurant.  Tiny-sized tortillas are usually given to you in a bundle when you buy a platter of meat in a street market--not made into individual tacos, except in el D.F.--but, again, you didn't advertise comida del D.F.  I honestly can't understand how this place is so popular--except maybe if you are a gringo looking to get away from Serranos or Garcias--then maybe you think this is something special.

Super friendly people, good variety and just for fun I checked in via FB and there were like 1,200 people who had checked in this 8 table place, wtf?

Anyways, being a Mexican food aficionado (and after living in Mexico for several years) I have to say that although the tacos are decent, they are far from authenticity.

I had carne asada con nopal (a platter with rice, black beans, carne asada and cactus leave) which was barely OK. The meat was like the asian fast food, you know? Softer than it should as if they add flour or something like that. The beans were runny, and the rice uneventful.

The taco al pastor was good but it was anything but authentic.

All in all, an OK place to swing by if you're in the area but nothing I would crave.

The interesting thing is that a lot of americans were eating there, good looking women, big Mercedes parked in the parking lot, I mean, it has it's drive for sure!

 - Really excellent staff;  super attentive, super caring.
 - Cans of pop are only 75 cents.
 - You can eat inside or outside.
 - The thick taco was interesting and almost satisfying.

CONS
 -  The flavor accents for the taco, thick taco, and tamale I had were completely bland, completely forgettable.
 - The two small parsings of salsa in little plastic containers were completely bland, completely forgettable.

This place has a classy looking menu board, some classy staff, and some utterly indescript food.

Looking at the price, I figure the taco was small and confirmed with the big, tall white tattoo guy behind the cashier, so I know how many to order.

The ones from Tacos Atoyas was only a okay compare to the ones in LA.   Usually the tacos I have are overflow with meat, but these are only half way filled.  Taste was a okay too.

My recommendations: absolutely hit up the fish tacos and the Oaxacan hot dog. 

The fish tacos are fantastic - lightly battered, crunchy, crisp and tasty (yeah for being well-seasoned!). Add a little bit of lime and sprinkle with the generous side of onions they provide and you've got yourself a fantastic dinner. The portion sizes here are a bit small, but reflective of the prices. The regular tacos are all $1. 

The Oaxacan hot dog - grilled bun, beans, lettuce, avocado, mayo, bacon and some other items that I'm missing. So, so delicious. The only minus is that they use a pretty standard hot dog. I'd love for them to use a better quality dog, but at the price, I understand. And the toppings are fantastic. Definitely try different things. The prices are very conducive to trying different things.",5,"[u' hot dog', u' fantastic dinner', u' hot dog', u' so delicious', u' hot dog']",2.15,[u' little bit'],-0.1875

I had a shrimp burrito, and fish, al pastor, carne asada, cabeza (Beef cheek.  Don't be a pussy, try it.  Just open your mouth bitch!), tacos.

Best al pastor I've ever had.  Probably best shrimp burrito as well.  Everything was a winner though.

On top of that, the guy behind the register was so friendly.  Last time I was called sir that many times it was a crackhead asking for change.

I love that they actually use corn tortillas for their tacos and the give you 3 different kinds of salsa and a side of grilled onions and jalapenos, which are really good.
Chorizo Tacos- The chorizo was a bright pink color. I really couldn't taste the actual chorizo flavor with the onions and cilantro on top.

Carne Asada Tacos- I found the carne asada to be a little greasy with not a whole lot of flavor. But if you add the grilled onions and jalapenos then it is a lot more flavorful.

Black Beans- Now I normally don't order black beans but something told me I should.  It was more like a black bean soup.  I liked the flavor.

I saw a few things on the menu that I would maybe come back to try.  They have menudo, which is rare on menus anymore.

They weren't overly busy, but almost every seat was taken. It really did seem like a street taco joint you would find in Mexico, basic seating, little decor, some selection of drinks. 

Next Positive - CHEAP - $2.00 for an authentic fish taco. Awesome. I ordered two, grabbed a drink and waited for only a few short minutes for my order. First off, I noticed they did a marinated cabbage mixture on the taco, instead of just raw cabbage. I really liked this, they stepped out of the norm. Unfortunately, I didn't particularly care for the flavor of the cabbage, (but that was because of my tastes, not because of their efforts), but with the fish it gave the entire thing a nice flavor. And I had no problem eating them both us in about 2 minutes. Good Stuff! 

They also give you caramelized  onions with your. I love caramelized onions and ate them all. This was an extra touch I hadn't seen. I am sure my breath wasn't all that fantastic, luckily I wasn't going back to an office meeting, but boy were they good!  

My only negative - I was still hungry - and this was probably my fault, I walked in starving. So I ordered a shrimp taco. The shrimp was marinated in a lime juice mixture, again a touch I liked, I just didn't care for it all that much. It was good, it just isn't my thing.

We passed  this little hole in the mole (pronounced however you want).  Do not turn into the corner gas station-there is no way unless you go over the bump.  

We're not too familiar with Oaxacan style cuisine but now we are hooked!

I walked up and was greeted by the owner who was overwhelmed by the walk-ins and take-out orders.  He was pleasant and apologetic about the wait.  I didn't care, coz I had time to digest the menu a bit.  I've never heard of...molote?  Tlayudas?

Hubby, a creature of habit, went with what he knew-carne asada burrito.  He said it was good, but he wanted more ingredients in there.

My little cutie pie ordered 2 fish tacos.  He ate everything!  ""What I like about this taco is the fish inside!""  He pointed to the moist and flaky center.

I wanted to order everything!  Okay, I didn't, but I wanted to.  I got the tacos al pastor, lengua and tripas.  I was so tempted to try the cabeza and menudo.  No one would help me eat that, so I passed for now.  The al pastor pork was very well marinated and spiced.  The lengua didn't have much taste or was it tasting me?  It was so tender, nevertheless.  I have to go back and get the tripas again.  I must have put too much salsa in there and couldn't taste it.  Molote...that was crunchy fried masa on the outside and pillow soft chorizo inside.  The food came with two kinds of salsas, a guacamole sauce, and a crema with some seasonings for the fish tacos.  I love the side of charred sweet onions and halved jalapenos.

We had the pecan horchata and little cutie pie had  Sprite to drink.  There is nothing like creamy home made horchata.  *stomach grumbling*

go now seriously and get some.

This place is easily now my top favorite mexican food joint in all of phoenix. Great cheap prices. There are three types of mexican restaurant places i go. 1) I have to for some reason. 2) I want some mexican food and this place was around. and 3) I crave this place in particular.

This place falls into my number 3 category easily. I literally love the guy at the register, he was really friendly and knew his menu well. That is always a good thing when your workers actually know the menu (i think he might be the owner). It is a small place, outdoor seating if you wish and pretty clean considering the outside aesthetics. 

The food:

Fish Tacos - Grade: A+, the fish was fresh and crunchy, the sauce was nice and tangy, the cabbage was crisp and fresh. The sauce and the lime were in perfect harmony.

Quesadilla -  Grade: A+crunchy corn tortilla, um for real, soo simple yet soo delicious, crunchy all the way through, generous amounts of cheese made each bite memorable

Tamales (spicy chicken) - Grade:  A, i wish the maiz was a little softer, but the texture was still good. I was hoping for the chicken to be spicier but i have a pallet for spicy pain... Even though it didn't get a plus it was still really good, just wasn't what i was expecting so a slight let down

Perro Oaxaca - Grade: A, the Oaxacan version of the Sonoran Hot Dog...still my votes go sonoran all the way through and through. This was REALLLY tasty still, but my only step fuss was, too much mayo on it, if it was SPICY mayo i wouldn't mind too much...
My opinion for the mayo is, either do light mayo, or do a chipotle mayo and put that one top...that would be great.

I mean, EVERYONE knows that the *good* stuff lies in plain, secluded little strip malls that are easily overlooked. 

Just pop in and get whatever you want. I am convinced Atoyac can do no wrong. I ordered a simple pastor burrito. Carne asada is easy to do, but the arduous process of choosing a marinade that's just-right is in my opinion the litmus test for whether or not a restaurant is legit. Part of me wanted to say it's too sweet, but as it disappeared fast, I realized it's unique, but really hits the spot. 

Sevice was fast, and all meals come with grilled onions and a grilled serrano, which is just the right amount of heat for me, and definitely too much for most people who will read this.

I used to love the food. I used to be a regular here and told just about anyone that would listen how good it was.

Here is the bad. I was eating lunch here one day and broke a tooth on a bone or large piece gristle. I was not just a chipped tooth, but an actual break. I informed Dan Maldonado, the owner, before I left. He was seemed genuinely concerned and cooperative.  I went directly to the dentist and was informed it would need  a crown.  A few days later I went to Tacos Atoyac to discuss this with Dan . He was the exact opposite and informed me that his cousin was a lawyer (big deal) and that it was up to me to prove it happened there. Well, I gave Dan the benefit of the doubt and let him know I was not there to shake him down. Really, all I wanted was an apology and a little help with the dental costs, which amounted to over $1,000. I left my card and waited a couple of weeks for a call.
 I never expected him to cover all of it, or even half of it. I was looking for a little acknowledgement.  I never got it. I stopped by a couple of times and Dan was either ""not there"" or too busy to talk. I expected more courtesy. To his credit, he offered to buy my burrito the last time I was there. Unfortunately,  it was was weak attempt to make amends. I did not accept, because this was never about money. 

As far as the food, make your own choice, but be careful. It could cost you more than $4.00 and the owner could care less about the repercussions to his customers.",1,"[u' genuinely concerned', u' own choice']",1,"[u' little help', u' little acknowledgement', u' weak attempt']",-0.75

The quesadilla was unlike one I've ever had, seeing as it's Oaxacan-style. It's more like a masa de maíz empanada filled with cheese and herbs, topped with black bean sauce, lettuce and another white cheese. It was AMAZING, very flavourful and something that I will definitely want to have again.

My recommendation would be to get the #9 Lil' Amadi.  In my case I just told the waiter I wanted a Drumstick, a Thigh and some Mac n Cheese.  He knew the exact correlating menu # and name.

My favorite uncle got the #2 Baby Ray with a side of Grits and a giant jar of Red Kool-Aid.  

The Chicken was so juicy and tender.  Fall off the bone with succulent delight wonderful.  The waffle, for how thin they are was perfect.  You'll think Belgian waffles are for wimps after having one of these.   There was a slight hint of cinnamon to them.  

The Mac n Cheese was addictive.  There was something to it?  Something I couldn't put my finger on as to why it was so good.  My son, who is also learning to eat big people food really enjoyed it.

I ate the entire meal, because I was paying $16 dollars for it. The side items, collard greens and Mac and cheese were very good. The cornbread was excellent. The manager walked by me several times, but never asked how my meal was. 

So I paid my $24, with tax and tip and Grape Kool aid and left, never to return. Lo Lo's you can't charge $16 for chicken that has been sitting around and expect your customers to come back.",1,[u' very good'],0.91,"[u' fried chicken', u' almost cold']",-1.2
YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Fist and last time LoLo's will get another dime of my hard earned money !! The food was good (I'll give them that-1 star) and our waiter ""Carlos"" did his absolute best to improve our experience (2nd star). 
The problem with this establishment is the Management: If that's what you call standing around in the parking lot talking to people and doing absolutely nothing to help your staff on a busy Saturday night. This gentleman must be related to someone because a Manger he is not !! What I was even more surprised  to find was that when I went through a few more reviews that most of the negative comments were regarding the Manager and to date nothing seems like it has changed !!So here was my 1st experience:
1). No reservations, there were 6 of us (45 min. wait).
2). Oder taken within 15-20 min.
3). Food took another 30 min to come and came out one plate @ a time (one plate came out, then 10 min. later another and so on) until they got to the last plate which took another 30 min to come out ( I like to Yelp, good and bad so yes I was looking @ the clock: In disbelief and to give an accurate review). So at this point we have been there almost 3 hours and keep in mind the orders were pretty basic: Fried Chicken, greens, mac & cheese, Fried Catfish, green beans and yams (most of what should be already in a pot-the only thing you need to do is season and fry the meat).
4). We asked for a Manager, no manager came -twice.
5). A server's chicken flew off the plate onto the floor, no Manager (next to us).
6). A server was cleaning off a table and dropped the plates, no Manger (next to us)
7) We finally stopped a bald gentleman with gold wire framed glasses who said he was the Manger (because the one we requested never came). We relayed our experience and the fact that by this time our guest was so upset that her food had taken so long (the last plate) that she couldn't even eat it. The Manager's response ""This is not the way we do business but we don't comp meals"" no eye contact but he repeated it twice like from memory (did I mention our bill was over $100.00). The Chicken dinner was $14 and It was not about the money it was about the Customer Service (but a trained and educated Manager would have known this) !
8). In comes Carlos (the Waiter), who we let know it was obvious he had no Management support and we knew he was doing his best. Again he was apologetic and sincere and even took $7 off of the bill (it was still over $100 for Fried Chicken and Cat Fish).
***So if you want to wait along time to be seated and even longer for your food, be ignored by Management (who could care less if you have a good experience or not) and pay over $100 for some pretty good chicken and fish - This is the place for you !!

Otherwise spend your money somewhere else where they ""Thank you for coming"" !",2,"[u' more surprised', u' accurate review', u' good experience', u' pretty good']",1.875,[u' negative comments'],-0.3

1st we went here this past weekend during bike week. My group was ready to go and check it out based on all the ""hype"" around this place. I don't hold the wait time to be seated against them. It was actually good based on how crowded they were with visitors. It only took them about 30 min to seat us. One good thing they do is text your phone when your table is ready. I thought that was a good idea. 

The overall atmosphere is good. Nice music playing, lighting etc. A really good atmosphere. I think this place might be great if you were going for drinks only. Good menu selection, good prices etc. So now I got you wondering why the one star review. 

It only took about 30 min to seat us but it took over 1 1/2 hour to get our food from the time we ordered. The server only checked on us once for refills during that entire wait. He comes out and said sorry for the wait but we are busier than usual and I guess it has to do with ""bike week"", then he says your order is up next there is only two orders ahead of you now. Let me think about the definition of the term ""next""...hmmm ""your order is up next, there are only two orders ahead of you"" well.....let's continue. A while later our food comes out and it was horrible. Let me repeat that horrible. I ordered the biscuits and gravy which is supposed to come with biscuits and gravy, eggs and potatoes. I ordered a side of bacon. What I got was biscuits and gravy, potatoes and my bacon. No eggs which I ordered over medium. The gravy was like paste and all of my food was cold. Not luke warm but cold. I told the server my eggs are not with my meal and he said they would be right out. This was no kidding 15 min later and they he brings them to me and says sorry but do you still want them. Are you kidding me? What type of service is this? The manager/owner whatever is not doing his/her job. This is not good ole southern food. I am from TX and you must be saying it is good ole Southern part of AZ food or something. 

I will not go to this place ever again. I visit AZ for business often and I am a creature of habit. They could have made a fan of me but blew it. I normally will give a place at least two visits before I give a review but the service is awful, the food was awful and the management was not prepared for a big crowd. The feedback I got from my friends is there food was cold, grits were watery, chicken was decent, atmosphere was great and service was horrible.

I particularly was ok with the sandwich that we had, t tasted like it had ingredients which were not bad. The sandwich had bacon turkey on a tomato bread. The tomato bread was interesting. They actually seemed to understand the rules of sandwich making. Which are :

-Soft fillings should be served on soft breads.
-Make sure there's a moisture barrier (i.e., something creamy or oily) between your -bread and wet ingredients (e.g., tomatoes).
-Keep slippery ingredients away from each other.
-Use a bread you'd be willing to eat on its own.
 
These are rather simple rules, but you would be surprised how often places don't understand them, and you get these sandwiches that one bite caused everything to poop out the back. The point of a sandwich is supposed to be that you can eat it easily while doing other things and not had stuff all over your hands.

I got the full size chicken cob salad with avocado for 9.30 (including tax). It's still a bit more expensive than non-airport grab-and-go places, but at least it's not $15.

When I first walked past paradise bakery & cafe, there was a line. I decided to go wait at the gate first. About half and hour or so after I came back and there was no line. I placed my order and got my salad in about 5 minutes.

The salad is not prepackaged, they actually assemble the salad after you've ordered. The full size portion is a decent size. I saw the guy making my salad using 1/2 of an avocado for the salad! Nom! Not just some tiny slices! The grilled chicken were precooked (not cook onsite) and came in a package. I was not a big fan of how the chicken tasted. it was just alright.

She returned with the same salad with my fork in the same spot with the seeds and add on but the quinoa was still missing.

I sat at the bar and was greeted by Casey, a super friendly sweetheart. My first drink was the Mandarin Raimu, a light and fruity delicious saketini.

Next...the miso soup. I was expecting a tiny bowl of brownish liquid with rehydrated seaweed and maybe some bonus tofu bits. Thank goodness I was soooo wrong. What I got was a heaping pot of miso deliciousness. The piping hot broth had a rich and silky quality. It was loaded with mushrooms, tofu, and curious tender little rice dumplings.

Next was the almond fish (tapas). It was a moist flaky strip of white fish wrapped in a delicate thin layer of crisp tempura batter, topped with almonds and spices. The sauces that were served on the side had the type of spiciness that you can only get from freshly ground ingredients. One was pickled wasabi...REAL wasabi. The other was a chili-peanut sauce. Heavenly.

My desert was a chocolate coconut sake martini. A yummy and creamy ending (#noporno) to a great light meal.

raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,"Johnny Chu is a master.  Sweet Pea and I followed him from Fate (which we loved) to Sens (which we liked a lot) and now to Sochu House (which we love.)  We've been big fans for several years and have eaten at each of his restaurants downtown many times, and after another delicious meal last night it occurred to me that I hadn't reviewed any of them!  Time to remedy that.

As a vegetarian, I am used to being under-considered.  In fact, I often tell people ""I'm a vegetarian- how good can food ever be?"" when they ask me how my meal at a restaurant is.  I love being a vegetarian, and I love the food I cook myself, but I am most often missing that foodgasm so often that I sit and watch my friends having at a restaurant.  This is not the case at Sochu House.  The man knows how to cook for carnivores AND vegetarians alike, equally as skillfully.  In fact, I'd go so far as to say his tofu is excellent, the best I've ever had.

We've been to the restaurant and ordered takeout many times, and both are top notch.  The restaurant has a cool, sexy downtown vibe, a great bar, and a great atmosphere.  Service has always been good when we've been there.  When we get takeout, they take the time to package the food in such a way that things that are crispy stay crispy, things that are fresh stay fresh, and things that are hot liquid stay in their containers.  This is far too rare at most restaurants.

I have eaten many different things there, all excellent, and I've seen others order many other things there both vegetarian and non-vegetarian, and I have NEVER seen a diner unhappy with their meal.  Never.  My absolute favorite is the hot and sour soup.  It is the best I've had in my entire life, and I'm a hot and sour soup long-time fan.  It has so many lovely chunks in there- pineapples, jalepenos, delightful noodles, mushrooms, tofu, and things I don't have any clue about and frankly don't care because it is delicious.

My friend and I went on a Sunday. The server was slow to great and take drink orders. She was worse than a car salesman with selling us the sake. They only have two flavors of bottled iced tea, neither of which are non-fruity. I ordered one and never got it. 

We got rice balls and chicken wontons as tapas, not only were they not great it was explained later that our food took so long because they were letting our appetizer settle. The rice balls were weird, just tasted like I had burnt rice on my stove. The wontons were okay.

The main dishes we had were pad Thai and yellow curry. The yellow curry was very oddly nutty and not spicy at all. My friend ordered pad Thai, it had things that were not listed on the menu in the dish. There was a weird sprinkle of stuff on top and we asked two waitresses what it was and it wasn't until the third time the listed all the ingredients.

raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,"Eh, we came to this place when everything had closed last Saturday (6/7/2014). The lot was pretty bare on a Saturday night after 8pm, so we were kinda wary but we were also really hungry. It also looked like it was closed since the windows are heavily blacked out with curtains, we had to look for their Hours Sign and saw they were open till 2am.

The decor inside is nice but has a club feel to it, the bar was closed for a private party when we arrived. There is a live DJ, but I think he was busy DJ'ing for the private party (which kinda got annoying because there would be a boom of music that was hard on the ears then it'd get turned down real low... not sure if that was the DJ or the private party messing around with the music), and the main dining room where we were seated was pretty empty. We had a large group of 6, and were seated ASAP though! The lighting is really dim (but looking at photos it looks well-lit??), and small candles are placed in the center of each table for ambiance. Menus were kinda hard to read in the dim light so it took a bit to be able to read everything.

What confused me was the items listed on the menu. The place is Asian Fusion/Thai, but there were things merged with Indian, Korean, Chinese, and Japanese food too. I know it's ""Asian Fusion"" but... when the menu is half a sheet of paper, I would have expected more plate options with the listed cultures I mentioned previously. Has a really nice list of vegetarian items, but when you're Asian, your diet is practically vegetarian, haha!

So we ended up ordering almost half the menu since, being Asians, we always order in large amounts to share with everyone! We ordered:

Bacon wrapped lychee (those who ate it said they would have preferred a fresh lychee as opposed to a dried lychee), bacon wrapped okra (those who ate it said it was good), oden noodles with bean sauce (eh, staple Asian dish), korean bbq (still sizzling hot in the pan), shrimp curry (which was really runny, had no flavor, random pineapple in it? and the spicy heat overpowered the dish), flat rice noodles (weird gummy, chewy texture, this is supposed to be like the Korean rice noodles ""topokki"" but they're not supposed to be gummy or chewy), fried tofu in some sauce (I missed the name of it, but it's fried tofu, can't go wrong there!), potstickers (eh, you can't really screw up potsickers, they're a pretty simple and staple dish in any Asian restaurant), and the sugar cane pork (sugar cane absorbed all the liquid from the pork, so the meat was dry, and I felt like I should be eating it in wonton soup instead).

Everything was ehhh OK, the portions are really meant for 1 person, not to really share with a large group, but we wanted to try everything that sounded interesting to us! But really, the price we paid we honestly could have gone to an Asian restaurant and for the same price get huge heaps of food on plates to share.

raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,"Joined some of my peeps here for dinner the other night.  I hadn't heard of this joint yet, so I had no idea what to expect.  I was the first to arrive, and was greeted in a timely fashion.  I was slightly put off at first, because each time the server came to the table to take drink orders, she appeared to be on her phone.  Oh, that's gonna go on Yelp for sure! But, I figured out that that's how they take down orders there (I confirmed this with her) so no points off for that!  

So, their menu has entree sized portions, but they encourage doing the smaller plates and sharing (i.e. Asian tapas).  Unfortch, all of my dining cohorts were meat eaters and I wasn't super hungry, so I just ordered the Green Papaya salad with crispy tofu.  The salad was delish and was dressed in a spicy citrus vinaigrette.  My friends ordered all kinds of stuff, including: Chicken Lollipops, Sugar Cane Pork (like a mini kebab but on a piece of sugar cane), BBQ Short Ribs, which everyone agreed was one of their least favorites, Pad Thai, Spring Rolls, Truffle Edamame, and much more.  Some of the folks enjoyed some adult drinks, one was called Blue Winter.  It was a martini with house-infused loganberry vodka and blue curacao and a sugared rim.  Another friend had the White Sin made of frou frou stuff.  For desserts, they ordered the Green Tea Cheesecake (which came garnished with some pink sauce that tasted like some kind of childhood bubblegum flavored medicine) and dessert wontons.  Two of the diners ordered an after dinner drink made with white and dark chocolate Godiva liqueur and Frangelico (except the didn't have that so they used Kahlua instead).

The decor was pretty sexy: white walls, red curtains, sexually charged artwork, blue lights.  I felt like getting it on as soon as I walked in the door.  Kudos.

All in all, we had a great time and enjoyed the food, drinks and service quite nicely.

The bacon wrapped lychee were awesome, but I would have liked more than three of them. The korean ribs were yummy as was the main dish. The green tea cheesecake was a work of deliciousness, but $7 for one the size of a hockey puck seemed a bit steep. Be aware that rice, noodles, etc are an extra charge unless the menu says it comes with it. Three tapas and a main dish was more than sufficient for two of us though. The food was flavorful and spicy, but not excessively so.

Their tapas are also served with a side of cabbage salad drizzled with ginger dressing which I could not get enough of. We also ordered their green tea cheesecake dessert. It is a tasty cheesecake but the green tea taste is barely there. 

The one thing that I was not extremely comfortable with is their loud music and slightly uncoordinated decorations. Upon entering the restaurant, it felt more like a bar rather than a restaurant.

raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,"Let me start by saying my husband and I have been OBSESSED with Chef Johnny Chu since the days he stood in front of an open flame in a 6ft open kitchen in a little 900 sq ft house on 3rd St known as ""Fate"".  We have been to most of his other restaurants after the tragic end of the Fate era, but have not been as satisfied.  Until last night.... when we finally had a chance to step into Sochu House.
Walking in, we were a little intimidated by the soft neon lights and huge sheets of hanging white cloth (we had just come from a movie and were in the very definition of casual attire).  It took a minute to be seated because the wait/host staff could not see us standing in front from behind some of that stated white cloth, but once seated we were quickly brought menus and cucumber water.  I asked about the reverse happy hour I saw on the website from 10:30pm-close, but apparently that was only offered in the bar.  Our waiter did offer to move us to some chaise lounges available in the bar area, but we decided a proper table was necessary to stuff our starving faces at the point.
We ordered: Wasabi Soy Chicken and Friend Tofu tapas and the House Dynamite with chicken entree (this was our favorite at Fate).  I held onto a menu because of the warnings of small portions from other reviews, and from our experience at Sens (his other tapas-style restaurant), I figured we might still be hungry after these 3 choices.  Surprisingly, these portions were pretty darn big and very filling! We walked out of there with a $50 bill (after drinks) and FULL, happy bellies!  We were especially please to find Johnny's home cooked goodness style we fell in love with at Fate had made a return at Sochu House.

They had a few issues with the bar being backed up and the POS system in the bar not working but no biggie. That kitchen was crankin out all the dishes on the menu in short order. Like a well oiled machine, they marched my food out to my table and demanded I annihilate it....which I did. We started with the always awesome truffle edamame (need I say more?) and my all time fave, Soup Gyoza. LIttle  pork Gyoza stuffed with pork and injected with this ginger soy broth that I kinda wanna bathe in. We also did the sweet chili wings, bacon wrapped lychee, sugar cane pork and a curry claypot. Everything was on point and delivered to perfection. The bacon wrapped lychee was the surprise hit for me. Now I will say I'd like a few more for the price, but still awesome and I'll get it again....and again...and again.   The wings were great, sweet with a touch of spice and super crispy. The sugar cane pork has also been one of my faves and I'm glad it's on the menu again. The claypot was super good too and for $10, it's a great must-try.

We were there for a drag king pageant, and decided to get dinner beforehand. We had the Saigon Egg Rolls, Thai Spring Rolls, and Tofu Wedges, with the Sweet Fried Wontons for dessert. 

The Saigon Egg Rolls were incredible! Served with a small salad, which helped cool our palates from the spicy (but oh so delicious) sauce. 

The Thai Spring Rolls were delicious, too, but nothing super special - for the price, I may opt for something different...that being said, the mint in these spring rolls was AMAZING. 

The Tofu Wedges were my favorite - I have a thing for fried tofu that's crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside...and these were PERFECT. Served with the standard spicy peanut sauce, these were a delightful end to our dinner. It was a super generous portion, too. 

The dessert definitely stole the show...the Sweet Fried Wontons blew us away. Cream cheese and goat cheese fried in a wonton skin, drizzled with a sweet strawberry sauce. My only complaint is the small portion - not enough to share with a friend/date, unless you're both already stuffed from dinner (and then it's perfect). 

My date and I just had water (also delicious, infused with cucumber!) and dinner was, including tip, just under $40.

Pad Thai - They make it with vermicelli noodles instead of egg noodles and it works! 
Crispy Fish Papaya Salad - crispy, light and refreshing. If you've never had papaya salad, try it here. They do a great job. The textures in the dish work harmoniously together.
Orange Puff - the sauce for this chicken dish is something i've never had before. I can't even say it resembles orange chicken because it's above that
Garlic Edamame - They've even made something as simple as edamame superb!
Green Tea Cheesecake - you can tell they don't actually make this on location and that it's shipped in, but it's still tasty. I crave this from time to time.
Pesto Edamame - Yes, it works! Pesto fans, you will enjoy this. The crunch of the edamame plus the nuttiness of the edamame is a blast in your mouth
Sizzling Shrimp - comes out sizzling, the sauce has a nice kick. Not overbearing, just the right amount of flavor
Hong Kong Flat Rice - A fun dish! The sauce is mildly sweet, almost resembles a Mongolian sauce. The noodles are dish-like pasta noodles.

We started off with a TAPAS the  BACON WRAPPED QUAIL EGGS and it was fabulous.  We then went on to the HOT & SOUR SOUP and it  was not your traditional variety but rather a tamarind base and making that more of broth.  Interesting and a nice take on Hot & Sour.  The DYNAMITE CHICKEN  was a clear disappointment and seemed more of a rendition of a Sweet and Sour and lacked any distinctive flavor.  We finally tried the PAD THAI and it was done with the very find noodles.  We decided to order the beef which was $4 extra and seemed rather high for a dish that was $10 and not a whole lot of beef either.  Guess 40% higher for a beef or shrimp option seemed out of balance.

Might want to try more of their TAPAS another time.  They have a TAPAS TUESDAY where the First Four Tapas per table only (please note this fine print) are $20.

Service was generally good till it got busy, when it truly took a very long time to get our entrees.  Overall it was not ""wow"" and neither was it disappointing.",3,"[u' good reviews', u' more retro', u' nice take', u' fine print', u' generally good']",2.916666667,[],0

Spicy Wonton
Sweet Soya
Thai Spring Rolls
Chicken Lollipops
Some fancy green beans

The food:

-Truffle Edamame $4: warm, buttery, flavorful, good amount of food, but too salty

-Pork Gyoza Soup $6: overpriced for what you get, you get 4 dumplings which are supposedly filled with soup and pork. unfortunately, the way our dumplings were made they stuck to each other and the bottom of the plate so they ripped open when we picked them up and the ""soup"" spilled out. only 1 dumpling made it to my mouth intact and the soup was alright, nothing to write home about

-Ginger Mint Duck Salad $9: good value - you get a few slices of duck meat on top of a bed of shredded cabbage, the dressing was very good, tasted like a traditional Vietnamese salad -- I would come back to this place for that salad, but watch out for the spice. I like spicy and this had my mouth tingling for a little while after

-House Dynamite with Chicken $11: okay value, but they should serve it with rice or recommend that you order a side of rice when you place your order. rice is cheap so it's annoying that they skimp on this. the other reviews saying this dish is spicy are NOT true. I barely tasted any spice at all, even though the plate was covered in red pepper flakes, they weren't hot. I liked the assortment of veggies, including baby corn, that they used in this dish

-Mango Monkey Martini $11: yuck. I'm not a big alcohol drinker and this was way too strong for my taste and sort of reminded me of medicine. my friend thought it was okay, but also really strong. I don't think ginger and mango are the right flavors to mix together.

Again the spice for it was sparse and I really didn't get a taste of traditional curry from it.  

Needless to say, I'm disappointed!  Sorry gang I really wanted this place to work for me, but it didn't.  It's not to say I don't have respect for Chef Chu, but I'll have to pass on this place.

I stood near the door for a couple minutes waiting to be greeting,  or at least be given some sort direction, but no one seemed to notice me. I looked towards the bar and made eye contact with the bartender but he quickly looked away. The staff didn't seem friendly and I kinda felt awkward just standing there. As I struggled with deciding to stay or go, a friendly girl named Naomi popped up out of no where and greeted me with a smile. She immediately apologized for the wait and was very kind in explaining the menu to me. 

I placed a pretty large order for my takeout. I ordered the Pad Thai, Hong Kong Flat Rice, Stir Fry Udon Noodle, Pork Pot Stickers, House Dynamite and Orange Chili. I knew the order would take a while so I settled in. Immediately, Naomi brought over some water and made certain there wasn't anything else I needed. Wonderful customer service. 

Now, the reason I give this place one star is because of the head cook, Nayir, and because of the food. 

After about 15 minutes since placing my order, I could hear the head cook yelling at the hostess who helped me and she was throwing a fit over my order. She was also yelling at the two other cooks in the kitchen with her. Why? I don't know. Nor did I care. It could've been something as simple as a miscommunication on the ticket. Regardless, it was extremely unprofessional of her to go on like that loudly enough for myself and other customers to hear. After a few minutes of hearing her complain about God knows what, I went up to Naomi, the hostess who took my order, and asked her to just cancel everything. I'd already paid but I didn't care anymore. Incidentally, Naomi happened to be standing right in front of the kitchen so when she asked me to reconsider, I gladly explained, loudly enough for everyone in the kitchen to hear, why I was upset and why I didn't trust food made by someone with that kind of unprofessional work ethic. At that moment Nayir stopped her rant and continued making my order without another word. 

I decided to take Naomi's suggestion and I waited a few moments longer. The food was ready. I took it home, tried it and was pretty disappointed. The Pad Thai lacked any flavor, The Hong Kong Flat Rice was still so spongy and undercooked that I couldn't chew it, the Pot Stickers tasted store bought and the House Dynamite was swimming in a sauce that resembled soy sauce colored water. There was no viscosity. The Orange Chili was decent but definitely not enough for me to return.

Johnny Chu, the Executive Chef and creative mastermind from Hong Kong is the man behind the legendary restaurants Fate and Sens, has created another downtown venue showcasing his skills with SoChu House Neo-Asian & Martini Bar, opened last year. In a foodie world where everything is ""fusion""-this and ""eclectic""-that, eventually those buzzwords mean nothing. Not true when you're in the capable hands, woks, pots and grills of Johnny. This is where he excels, marrying a variety of tastes and cooking methods, turning it into something really exciting. 

Not just some catch-phrase to be bandied about, the eclectic menu at Sochu House is inventive, featuring a variety of tapas and entrées with an inspiring array of Chinese, Japanese, Thai and even Western flavors. The sauces and spices are enlightening, titillating, tempting and always entertaining in a way that's oh-so Chu. Much of the food preparation is done in cast iron and clay pots. Sochu House presents four different tapas menus with around ten items apiece priced between $5 and $12 per selection. 

Our friendly, capable server, Lynn, expertly helped us navigate our way through the tantalizing menu. 

The first Tapas menu offers Bo Luc Lac, also known as ""Shaky Beef,"" has thick, chunks of tender, onion/black pepper marinated beef served with a green leaf sesame salad. A crowd-pleaser is Soup Gyoza. These Shanghai dumplings offer a scoop of pork and rich, clear soup broth inside of a thin, twisted dumpling blanket bathed in a ponzu-like sauce. 

The Kushiage Tapas offerings are all Japanese panko crusted and flash fried. Don't pass up the succulent Sugar Cane Pork. The ground pork is marinated in ginger and lemongrass panko with a pool of pineapple ginger sauce. Each formed into a little ""drumstick"" on a length of sugar cane. 

The Robata Grill Tapas are traditionally prepared over a glowing pyramid of baton-shaped charcoal. A skewer of marinated chicken served with an astounding sweet (and sinus-cleansing) wasabi will keep you on your toes. More, more, more! Wait ... there's more, alright.

Lookin' for noodles? Sochu House has flat noodles, rice noodles, udon noodles, crispy noodles and--well--oodles of noodles. The Crispy Noodle Island gives you a bowl of baby bok choy, mushroom, carrots, snow peas, broccoli, baby corn, onion and a choice of Chinese style tofu, shrimp, beef or chicken all nestled in a lovely cradle of crispy noodles for $11. Three other noodle dishes are available.

Finish off the meal with a flourish. The mouth-watering Sweet Wontons are filled with cream cheese and goat cheese, then flash fried with strawberry puree sauce and dusted with powdered sugar for $5. 

Sochu House promises martinis and delivers more, including stupendous, handcrafted ""saketinis."" Try their exotic Sweet Karma, Lust, Hot 'n' Dirty Martini, or my own personal favorite, the Pinku No Hana. This tastes exactly like Hawaii smells and even feels, thanks to the jasmine infused vodka. 

Check out SoChu House Daily Specials. Try Tapas Tuesday with four tapas for $20. Grab someone special for Date Night Thursday and enjoy a four course meal for $30. 

SoChu House just may be your next home. And that's so Chu.

The beef was also overcooked and somewhat flavorless. The curry was very spicy but otherwise strangely bland. Steamed rice was extra and came in a cup sized bowl. If I had been told that the shrimp dish was store-bought and microwaved, I would not have argued with that.

We have been here several times now and have enjoyed our experiences each time. The service, food, drinks, and environment are all consistently excellent. The prices are a little high, but we expect that. While it's not really a place for an everyday meal, it is nice for a special occasion or a night out! :) For example, we had a very nice time on Valentines Day earlier this year.

The servers are always excellent, friendly, helpful, and polite. They are also there only when you need them; otherwise, they know to give you your space. I adore this quality! I hate being pestered, but at the same time, I don't want to be ignored! :) 

The food is incredible, but some of the portions are on the smaller side. Still, it is definitely quality and presentation over quantity. Nonetheless, we still leave with full bellies every time! My only complaint would be the dessert cream cheese wontons I got one time. It was a bit pricey and only came with two tiny wontons. The sauce was delicious, at least! 

I also love the name in general... it is an awesome play on words with Johnny's family name and, I believe, the Japanese alcohol ""Shochu."" While the food is definitely a fusion, there are some Japanese elements in the dishes... especially presentation. Food should be beautiful AND delicious, and this is something that the Japanese and Johnny Chu have truly mastered. It is a perfect name for an excellent restaurant, and we will definitely be back sometime in the future.",5,"[u' huge fans', u' consistently excellent', u' special occasion', u' very nice', u' always excellent', u' full bellies', u' awesome play', u' perfect name', u' excellent restaurant']",6.887142857,"[u' everyday meal', u' only complaint']",-0.35

Fish Salad on papaya slaw......dressing was a sweet chile that ran to the bottom of the bowl and did nothing for the generous piece of fried fish and chewy slaw.
Green Papaya salad with tofu....too similar to fish salad and the tofu has no flavor since they don't seem to marinate it.

Sochu House is the opposite. It is all about atmosphere and decor. Trendy, as they say. But it was nothing I would look for. We went for lunch, so I think the menu is a little different. If you go for dinner your experience may differ. Food was okay--spring rolls good, wings very good, red curry okay. We ordered the spicy lemongrass dish and asked for chicken--which was supposedly one of the choices along with shrimp or fish. The waiter returned to say the chef refused to make it with chicken because it would not taste right. So, we ordered it vegetarian and it sucked. I've had better at countless places in the Valley.

It had a hint of sweet and lots of spice.  For dessert I had a sweet wonton.  Be warned, the dessert was very small in size.

raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,"Asian-fusion cuisine at its finest. Sochu House serves up innovative tapas-style Asian bites, as well as larger entrees and noodle dishes. The cuisine spans several types of Asian regions, with a hint of Western influence. 

We ventured in on a Sunday night for dinner. Since there was a Groupon for Sochu House expiring soon (One of the reasons why we went that day), there was a slight wait since it appeared to be a little busier than usual for them (15 minutes). We browsed through the menu, and ordered a few tapas items, and shared an entree.

The tapas is served izakaya-style, in that it's served to you as it's made. We tried the soup gyoza, the sochu tofu, and another dish that escapes my mind. The soup gyoza was excellent. The pork filling was juicy, tender, and the broth inside the dumpling was divine. The outer dough of the dumpling was perfectly cooked. The only slight negative was that it was served on a dish. I would have liked it to be served in a bowl so I could spoon up the rest of that lovely broth more easily! The sochu tofu was also very good. The tofu was perfectly crisp on the outside, with a soft tofu texture on the inside. The dipping sauces were very nice.

While the entree was good (Red curry with chicken), the real standouts were the tapas. The curry had a myriad of vegetables, including some okra, which I appreciate as an ingredient in any cuisine, but for me it tasted too gummy/slimy (As okra tends to be) compared to the other vegetables. It was a generous portion of curry, although rice is served on the side and is an extra charge.

The location is a bit odd, as it's in a strip mall neighboring fast-food type establishments (e.g., a Coney Island dog place), and is across the street from Honey Bear's BBQ. 

I love frequenting restaurants where the chef works hard to create delicious, creative meals, and the passion of chef Johnny Chu shows in each bite of delicious tapas.

So I have a long history of having Johnny's place being my go to place. I cannot tell you how many people I took to Sens. I literally believe it was in the 100s. I tried to start every night there when I was living downtown and most nights ended there. 

Then I moved to Midtown and had a regular bird and we would do date night there but it just wasn't the same in terms of frequency. 

Then came ASU and downtown changed and they fucked up his street and he'd had his eye on the new spot that is now Sochu House for a while and the stars aligned and he moved. And I moved back downtown literally a mile from Sochu House.

And so I started going there at least once a weekend and it felt like old times with some of the old bartenders and the ever clever and interesting Johnny... 

But, fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, people started being honest with me. The problem is that I'm a vegan and I don't eat anything that comes from an animal. Like, if I know an animal molecule is in my food, I won't eat it. 

And I found out there's fish sauce in the Papaya salad, which was one of my favorite things on Earth. And there's fish sauce in some of the sauces. So what used to be my favorite place on Earth became a source of stress and distrust. 

So I had to stop eating there. But I still go for the drinks. Just not like I used to...

I've tried almost every tapa dish and quite a few of the entrees. I can honestly say there hasn't been a dish on the menu I've tried and said ""No, I wouldn't order that again."" The last time we went (aka 3 days ago), I ordered the sugar cane pork for the first time. Umm, why hadn't I done that before? I could probably eat that all day. I'm also a huge fan of their baby bok choy, like HUGE fan. It's so garlicky and wonderful. Also, give me all the bacon wrapped okra please. All-of-it. I love to end the meal with their wontons, cheesy, fruity, yumminess. 

I will say that if you are someone who is very sensitive to spice, you may not like a lot of the dishes. Everything is so effing good, but there is a kick to many dishes. Ask your server for suggestions if you have a delicate palette, or you know, buck up and enjoy the ride. 

In my first review, I said I was too hungover to try the drinks, now I specifically go to Sochu to get drinks! Their saketinis are so, so, very good. Well worth the $11 price tag. I usually for the cucumber-mint one (I think it's Kyyuri Minto or something like that), whatever it is, it's tasty as hell, strong as hell, and makes me happy. Lust is a great one, it's really sweet and I like it as a dessert cocktail. They also have a few spicy martinis (Spicy Mama/Hot Mama?) that are indeed super spicy, so be wary! They are quite good, but I'll be damned if my mouth wasn't on fire. For a good time, read the drink descriptions out loud. Just maybe not around your parents. 

I also love that this place is open late. So rare for Phoenix. And the specials! Tuesdays are Tapas Tuesdays, 3 tapas for $20. Thursdays are Date Nights, 4 courses for $30 (1 salad, 1 tapa, 1 entree, dessert). I believe Mondays have a Martini special and Wednesday nights after 9 they have a comedy show in the bar/lounge area. 

Also, shout out to Johnny! When he is there, he goes around to all the tables and checks in. We go enough that he remembers us and really takes his time to chat.

I'm systematically attempting to get through the entire menu, so I feel like I've tried a large portion of it, and I have not been disappointed once. There are a few dishes that I always come back to though: the sizzling shrimp (get it with a side of rice to make sure you eat all of the sauce), the hot and sour soup (this is THE best hot and sour soup I've ever had and I've been known to eat multiple orders in the same visit), the sugar cane pork, and the bacon wrapped lychee. Other notable dishes are the bacon wrapped quail egg, the spicy wonton, and the Asian 5 spice quail. I have yet to try any of the actual entrees, but if the tapas are any indication I'm sure they're delicious as well (and trust me, I'll get to them sooner or later). 

Their cocktails menu is also diverse and well-rounded. There are sweet drinks, spicy drinks, and everything in between.

raVyoZbWWuN7JcFUdT7k2g,"My  girlfriend and I decided to finally try Sochu House for the first time two nights ago as it is within walking distance from our condo. 
We were surprised at how interesting, eclectic and not to mention BIg it was inside, as it has an unassuming entrance in a fairly seedy little strip mall.
As far as bevies go The sake menu is good and they have flights available to try different varieties. The cocktail menu is very good and the drinks come out from the very sexy and atmospherically lit bar side. I found the regular liquor selection to be a little overpriced : 9 bucks for a JW Red is about 2 bucks too much however they do have reasonable prices on booze in general. 
We decided to share a bunch of tapas and a large miso soup. 

The lollipop chicken is great! Tasty, and succulent albeit a tad messy to eat as it's finger food and is saucy. But I love eating with my mits, my girlfriend not so much.

The pork wrapped sugarcane was similarly presented as the chicken but was not as tasty as I  had hoped. The pork was ground and a bit granular and a touch dry while the sugarcane inside though juicy was almost tasteless so the sweet/savory contrast was minimal and I kinda thought the sauce was too similar to the lollipop dish.

The duck salad was FANTASTIC! Like an Asian coleslaw with tender fillets of duck breast. It was savory and sweet and crunchy and tender all at once. Arguably the best salad with protein I have ever had, and I have it a lot! A MUST TRY!

The miso soup with shrimp was pretty good.  The chewy rice disks were fun to eat but I found the broth to be a little thin and not quite salty enough. However, there we're a good amount of shrimp and it was nice and hot.  I would have it again.

Service: I worked in the service industry for 20 years and just finished my last stint as a bartender in sept. I have served, managed and even washed dishes.
Our waitress was young and likely a new server.  She tried to explain their Date Night special but was very unclear what was included. She kept coming back over to add bits of info about it. Neither of us understood what she was talking about so we dismissed it and ordered a la carte.  She could have just read off a composed script or taken the time to memorize the special clearly. Which is sop in most restaurants. 
Having said that she was very friendly and very attentive to all of her tables and made no other mistakes other than trying to take my red wine away before I was finished the last sip. Always ask if you can take a seemingly empty drink away. Server 101. Like I said she is likely still learning.  She will be great in a few years. 
I was a littler taken aback when I witnessed who I thought might be a manager, he was a slight Asian guy, wiping his nose with a tissue right near the central server station and next to the food pick up area at the semi-open kitchen. Service 101: NEVER touch your nose or even face in view of customers.  If you need to, go to the back or the restroom. Gross. I almost said something to our server but decided to say it here instead. 
Also, the central service area is interesting but flanked on either side by rolling carts with dirty dish bins into which the servers clear.  This is unsightly and loud and should be done in the dish pit and not the middle Of the restaurant. I don't want to e looking at dirty plates while I eat. This isn't a cafeteria.
Over all I think this is a great start.  We will certainly return and bring our guests as well.  I am also curious to see how it is as a night spot as the bar is sexy and they have guest djs.

The waitress said the delay was because the soup was ""made to order."" Regardless, I had her wrap it up and was frankly a bit shocked that $15 ($11 for the soup and an extra $4 I wasn't expecting for the shrimp option) bought me about 1 pint of soup.

Sochu lacks the intimacy of Sens, but takes other familiar elements to entirely new levels.

I wasn't too impressed with the drinks/bartenders the night I was there. I had to create my own drink. Normally, you can give an experienced bartender a direction you want to go (a couple of spirits/mixers you like) and they can suggest a drink from the menu or craft something specifically for you. The bartenders that night appeared unable or unwilling to do either. So, I gave them a specific list of ingredients...which came out pretty good actually (patting myself on the back).

We tried some bites from the menu too. They were all appetizers, but they were all very tasty. Nothing too filling, as we all shared them; but it did whet my appetite. I wouldn't be opposed to returning for a full meal. This seems like it might be a good place for a Happy Hour too (although that isn't when I visited).

We showed up on a Tuesday when trying to find some place that would have Thai or Vietnamese food around 8pm. Easier said than done in the west valley this time during the week. It turned out to be a good thing.

Tapas Tuesday was an enjoyable experience. Wife wanted the bacon wrapped lychee. The lychee had a nice texture and... well... bacon. I wanted the Korean short ribs and was not disappointed at all.  I could totally see going back on a Tuesday and ordering 3 orders of that for dinner with a couple of friends :p

Portions vs prices were a bit off unless you came in for a special. The food is great but unless you are sticking with daily specials, it can get spendy. Also entrees do not come with any form of starch. No rice, noodles, etc.

That said the food was great and 3 tapas and 1 entree was plenty filling for 2 people.

As for the drinks. I ordered 1 martini. If you are a James Bond fan (aka vodka martini) you'll be fine. If I want a traditional one, I prefer gin. So I ordered something sweet (I think Blue Winter?). It was interesting, different from anything I've tried before, and not overpowering. That said I'm a big guy and 1 of them did give me a bit of some tipsy for a little bit. When the menu says that the drinks are strong, they are not kidding. Which is strange because it did not have any of that vodka bite to it. Martinis are $10 or $11 but one of the daily specials has them $3 off and we didn't look at the happy hour specials (we were on the restaurant side).

Overall, I'd definitely go back. Tuesday seems like a great day because the tapas were enjoyable and that's a good way to get some variety.

The food is a unique and creative Asian fusion. The mint pepper chicken dinner plate was amazing. It bursted with flavor from healthy white meat chicken pieces (fried with light skin, no breading), water chestnut, and sweet juicy pineapple chunks. The sauce contained a great blend of spices and was good enough to eat itself. For tapas, the wasabi soy chicken was fresh, nicely grilled, and had a thin layer of teriyaki. It came with the most stunning fresh wasabi and wasabi-soy sauce I have ever had. The quail tapas was very small, but had a good Chinese duck style flavor. However, the green tea cheesecake dessert was a bit disappointing, since it basically tasted like a regular cheesecake. 

Sochu House is located in a bit of an odd location on a high-traffic route, which is a deterrent to going back.

Service was atrocious...horrible.. down right nonexistent. First off I am in the industry so I am very very easy going when it comes to service.

15 minutes later (that is being generous) he brings my bottled ice tea... no other drinks though. Hmm odd but maybe the bar w/2 people at it is slammed.  20 MINUTES LATER after food starts arriving, and after my friend asked the waiter, the rest of the party gets their wines (that was only 2 people, not a huge party). 

So the food comes out right (because there was a food runner) we were missing only one side of rice we ordered. Which was no biggie. Food was amazing, can't say enough good about it! 

We finish and the server never even came back to see how the food was. After he came back, still no apologies, no clue, it took about 30-40 minutes to figure how to split our check. This was after he brought me the not split check and with the rice they forgot to bring us.

The food was lackluster. I did not enjoy the chicken lollipops - sauce was too thick and had little flavor. Orange puffs were pretty good, a little spicy with plenty of orange flavor, but simple. I did like the Sochu tofu - thought the tofu was fried well and dipping sauces were nice.

I had high hopes for Sochu House and was prepared for some kinks based on the reviews.  After having my In-Laws come down for lunch on a Wednesday, kinks are definitely what we experienced .

We were sat at a wet table, thank you for wiping it clean but maybe have a dry cloth as well.  We ordered drinks, after waiting about 10 minutes, and waited another 15 minutes before another server checked on us to which we had to ask about our drinks.  We were then informed that 2 of the drinks ordered, Sapporo Draft, were unavailable.  I canceled the beer order.  Luckily we ordered our food at the same time we ordered our drinks.

Having Tapas on your menu is great, and when we order food and specifically ask to ""start with..."" I would expect that to be noted.  Instead our food was brought out at random.  We enjoyed the White Truffle Edamame, super tasty.  We also had the wings, spicy and tasty, along with the crispy wanton, very tasty and the sauces that accompanied them were great.  My Wife and her Father had the Pad Thai, I thought it was good, but they said it was spicy.  I enjoyed the lunch special but have since forgotten the name.  We also had the crispy fish salad.  All of the food was delicious and well worth every penny.

What put the cherry on top of a ""bad service sundae"" was when a glass of water was spilled in the lap of my Mother In-Law during clearing the table.  When something like this happens it is an accident and easily understood if a simple, sincere apology is given, and maybe even a Manager told about what happened, neither of these were done.  After this we receive our check with our canceled drinks still on the tab, this too had to be brought to our server's attention to be removed.

What kept this from being a total rant on bad service is because the Manager stopped us on our way out and asked why one of us had wet pants and whose fault it was.  Had this gone unnoticed I don't think that even the wonderful food could justify a one star rating.   She in turn refunded our bill, thank you. 

I do hope that this is one of the last low star ratings Sochu receives.  The restaurant has great potential and a tasty menu to back it up.

This place will murder you, I just got through with a lengthy visit with a local ER with my entire family after they ate this death food. They are so sick they can't stand. Everyone that ate a burger is bed ridden and it has turned a whole family into a horror film. Vincent Price couldn't make this up. They are so sick they had to be driven to the ER and then wheeled one by one into the hospital. I am worried to the point of hand wringing. Did they have intercourse with the burgers? Did they summon them from the 666th level of hell with some necronomicon just to serve them to unsuspecting customers? What is going on?

Things changed when the main dishes arrived, however.  Since people had recommended the Thai food, we went with the green curry and the pad ki mao. As with the rest of the food, the portions were extremely generous for the price.  The pad ki mao had a nice amount of spice and was well balanced between shrimp, vegetables, and noodles.  Although there were some ""Pan-Asian"" touches, I must say that the taste of this dish reminded me of Thailand.  The real star of the show, however, was the green curry.

Previous to tonight, I would have given them 3 stars. The food has been good on all three visits (we got takeout). Not amazing, but good. Would love to see more veggies in the Panang Curry, but it's still yummy.

Tonight, I placed an order using their online ordering system. BIG MISTAKE. The timeframe for ASAP is advertised to be 20 minutes. Our order wasn't ready for an additional 15 minutes! When I complained, she said that they don't receive the online orders right away. It gets faxed to them sometime after your place your order. She also claimed to have tried to call me to let me know the order would be ready later than the time provided on the receipt, which is an out and out LIE. I had my phone with me the whole time, and never received a call.

I was fine with that, and went next door briefly to get a soda. When I returned, I saw the delivery driver pass by me with the party order and assumed mine would be up soon, if not next. After all, cooking with a wok is done with small items at high heat and is very quick to prepare. About 35 minutes after I ordered, someone came out and told me that they were waiting on just one more item. This does not bode well for the condition of the other items that were presumably already complete and ready. Meanwhile, order after order after order of takeout for other people was brought out. Nobody offered me a beverage or even an apology. When my food finally came out after literally FIFTY-FOUR MINUTES, I was still offered no apology until I pointed out the time frame to the cashier. All she said was ""sorry.""  If they really wanted my repeat business they would have given me a reason to return, such as a coupon.

cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw,"As we drove by the QT and it's grubby little strip mall on Cactus near Cave Creek Road, I noticed a sign for a new restaurant, Noodle & Rice. For the next few days many coupons for it turned up on various sites including Restaurant.com.  Given such an aggressive marketing campaign, we had to give it a try. Armed with our coupons, we arrived at lunch time. It's a small place with a total of about twelve tables and booths. Make sure you get a booth, because the chairs are deadly uncomfortable. The plastic faux brick black wall and institutional gray paint give the place a kind of depressing air, lightened only by the turquoise banquettes and some leftover prints of Italian food on one wall. However, our server had a pleasant smile, and the menu showed promise.

     Noodle & Rice is an Asian restaurant, serving Thai, Japanese, and Chinese food. The prices at lunch are so reasonable we didn't even need to use our coupons. There are 22 entrees that can be had for $3.95, but for another $2 you can add an egg roll, soup, and a drink. I suggest you do this, because the hot and sour soup is one of the best I've had, and the egg roll is delicious too. China Mist iced tea is served here, and if you opt for hot tea you have your choice of several different kinds, served in a cute little teapot and matching cup. I opted to get chow mein noodles instead of white rice for an extra fifty cents, and I'm glad I did, because they were right up there with the hot and sour soup. Actually they outshone my entree of pad prik with beef and vegetables in a spicy brown sauce, because the beef was a little on the tough side, although still quite flavorful. Ken had shrimp in lobster sauce. The shrimp were properly cooked and the sauce was good, but, not being a green pepper lover, he thought there were too many on the plate. Oddly, at the end of our meal, we were not given fortune cookies.

     There are lots of things I want to try when we return. Appetizers include pot stickers 
($3.95), and chicken satay ($5.95). Tom Yum and Tom Kar soup (which has coconut milk in it) are both $3.50/$4.95. I love Tonkatsu sauce, so I may go for the chicken ($5.95). Panang Noodles ($6.95) are crispy wide rice noodles served with chicken or beef in a curry and coconut milk sauce. The most expensive thing on the menu is soft shell crab with either black pepper or curry powder at $10.95  A little less are two fried talapia (sic) dishes, one with Thai herbs, peppers, eggplant and basil, the other with a curry sauce sprinkled with minced kaffir lime leaves and fresh chili (both $8.95. Happily there's Thai iced coffee and tea, and for dessert green tea or coconut pineapple ice cream.

I'm not quite certain what to make of this restaurant because I was expecting an order-up type, but it turned out to be a sit-down place. Inside, the place is small with no more than 30 in occupancy tops.  A little cozy I might say if it was packed.  Fortunately, I was a little latish for lunch so hardly anyone was there.  The decor is a mishmash of ?!?!? which you'll have to see for yourself.  Nothing earth-shattering or trendy, but I just couldn't quite describe it so I'll leave it at that.

I ordered the Pepper Steak from the lunch special in the Rice Entrees group.  It comes with egg roll, soup  and a drink for an unbelievable price of $5.95.  The egg roll (chicken) came first - which came first - followed by the soup (hot & sour).  The egg roll was really good but the soup was just ok.  Soon after, I got my entree which looked appetizing as I took its picture.  It was definitely fresh because the mushrooms and peppers were crunchy, however, I felt it lacked spice.  Condiments were nowhere to be seen on my table nor the table next to me, so I couldn't flavor it to my liking.  It wasn't bad but I was not blown away.  Next time, I will try the entrees from other yelpers who gave this place 4 stars.

First this was my first and will be my only order placed. At 11:45 AM I placed and order for Chicken Fried Rice. This is always my first order when going to a new place for lunch. I was told my order would take 30 minutes. Thirty minutes for a simple dish at lunchtime on a Monday? When I arrived 30 minutes later the girl out front asked who I was and went to the kitchen. When she came back she said he had just started preparing it for me.

Before arriving I was expecting a well oiled machine that could just not keep up with the volume because their food was just so good. But I was wrong, it's a very small place and seems quite dysfunctional. There were only two other to-go orders packed and ready and a total of ten people dining inside.

While I was waiting a previous lunchtime customer came back in and was obviously very disappointed. She had had to wait 20 minutes to come pick up her order and when she got home it was cold. Cold enough to bring back the meal and ask for a refund.

She had ordered the $6.95 lunch special but had told them she didn't want the drink which was included in the price. But the counter girl wanted to refund her $3.95 and not the $6.95 she had paid. This was a quite bizarre ordeal to witness. The girl behind the counter arguing with the customer and trying to short change her refund.

I've tasted the Tom Ka and the Tom Gai, both excellent.  The crab rangoon is the best I have ever eaten.  It isn't like you will find anywhere else.  They add a liberal dose of pepper.  Edamame is a great starter.

On the heavier side (read that as fried) The lemon chicken and the orange chicken are fried in a light batter then served with the sauce.  Lemon is more tangy and is absolutely delicious.  I prefer the orange though because it is quite spicy.  They both tasted great.  The quality of the meat was excellent.

The fried rice is rather plain in contrast to the pungent flavors of the main courses.  That worked just fine for me.  The only thing I have tasted there that I would not order again was the hot and sour soup.  It was more vinegary than i expected.  I guess I need convention when it comes to my hot and sour.

cXdQ3H0GqcIzRgrvBEaBxw,"Love this little spot. Love the prices. Love the food. 

I am guilty on occasion of being a bit of a cheapskate, so I'm tempted to just emphasize the low cost of dining at Noodle and Rice. That would be an injustice, however, since the food is great and equivalent to a much more expensive restaurant. I guess there's a lot to be said for low overhead, the benefit of an odd location facing a Quik Trip convenience store.

N & R is cozy. Not small. That would imply it's a problem. Cozy. There are just eight tables, each seating four, and a couple of stools. That's it. The décor is fun. And the restaurant seems to do a thriving carryout and delivery business. Our recent visit was kind of late, just an hour before their 9:00 p.m. closing time. No problem getting a table, but it can be an issue at other times.

We love the Thai Iced Tea. The 99 cent chicken eggs rolls with sweet and sour sauce are tasty. We ordered and shared both Thai and Chinese offerings. I'm sure this is a violation of foodie purist code, but it works well for our taste buds. The Panang Curry is especially delicious. Despite the low prices, N & R is generous with the chicken in the dishes we ordered. And the menu is surprisingly diverse for such a tiny establishment.

The kids meals are amazingly affordable, just $2.95 including drink.  

Yes, I know I ended up emphasizing the restaurant's low prices, which I promised I wouldn't do. Oh well.

We dined in on a Wednesday night. It was indeed busy - plenty of dine in customers AND take out orders. Unfortunately, we had to wait 50 or so minutes for our food. This left us a tad hangry for a bit - small Asian place like this...I typically assume hot plates to come out quick.

*note for vegetarians* I was hoping to try the Tom Yum soup and the curries...(hence the reason we got two noodle dishes), but they all have a fish sauce already cooked into it. That was a big bummer, and the reason why this place loses an additional star.

Flavor was a complete no-show --- except for the egg roll, which tasted of cinnamon (extra chewy, but not bad), and the hot and sour soup, which had a decidedly metallic, ""tinny"" flavor (bad).

The kung pao was also flavorless and not spicy, despite the fact that I ordered it extra spicy.  Based on prior reviews, I should have been breathing fire, which makes me wonder if there wasn't a substitute cook in the kitchen that day.

We ordered orange chicken for the kids, which was just battered (in a not so good batter) and had the ""sauce"" on the side-a but weird. My kids love orange chicken! But not this one they barely had a bite or two and we ended up throwing it all away. 

I ordered the kungpao chicken and ""fried rice"" it was edible but I can't say I enjoyed it.   The chicken was okay but not your traditional kungpao and the ""fried rice"" was merely steamed rice with soy sauce and a little fried egg, - no flavor, no veggies, no bueno! 
My husband ordered the drunken noodles, they were DRY, definitely missing sauce and flavor.

I've tried a number of items on their menu - sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, panang curry - and they've all been top-notch. The dishes served with battered meats are always crispy and flavorful, the vegetables are always fresh and have a good bite to them - and it's not just because they are always delivered (not dine-in, but delivery) with sauce on the side so that stuff doesn't have time to get soggy. 

The pad Thai and panang noodles are excellent. Crab puffs are tasty and (I'd guess) made in-store, since I've never seen a pre-made rangoon that has fresh diced peppers in it. The egg rolls are unusual but tasty, with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon.

The staff is always friendly, and delivery has always been right on the mark; generally it takes 45 minutes for delivery, but when they say 45 minutes, they have *always* been there 45 minutes or sooner.

To the person who rated a star because it took an extra 15 minutes to get the order, I can say that out of fifteen times ordering at this place I've *never* failed to receive the callback they mentioned; I would be more likely to believe that you misentered the telephone number.

Dining in can be a bit cramped, and if I were to consider this as a dine-in I'd probably give it more like 3.5 stars; it really is a hole-in-the-wall, and seating is a bit cramped, probably not a good decor or ambiance for 'date night'.

3 kinds of nasty-looking, picked-apart fish in puddles of grease
teriyaki chicken slices swimming in 5/8"" of grease
breaded, deep-fried, syrup-drenched rotten (as in ""not safe to eat"") chicken
""pork tamales"" (seriously, wtf?)

More importantly, as a former chef I'm surprised the health department hasn't swooped in - every single dish was served lukewarm at best, there was no steam rising from the steam tables, and the cold trays were also at room temperature.  The nastiest thing was the tray with a lukewarm pile of old, crusty tuna salad on it - all I can say is that it was foul and i hope nobody actually ate it or the oysters next to it...  

After seeing all this, I definitely avoided the sushi bar and mongolian grill - no use in tempting fate.  Overall, I was so grossed out that I only ate one plate before leaving (for the record, I'm a biggish guy, usually I will chow down 3-4 plates at a good buffet).

In short, I know that there really are no good chinese buffets in Phoenix any more, but this was absolutely the worst food I have ever experienced anywhere in the city.  Worse yet, their lack of sanitation and temperature control makes dining into a russian roulette game for your GI tract.

Of course, since I came in alone with a book, I was seated in the darkest dining area next to a table with screaming children. This should have been my sign that the staff already knew I was not their target clientele and were determined to extract my $14 with the least effort to themselves. 

Standard Chinese buffet food must come in vast tubs from Sysco, as the Chinese dishes are absolutely identical to the Chinese dishes at every other mediocre buffet in Phoenix. This one appears to have a larger selection of non-Chinese food, including the mysterious pork tamale mentioned by others. It all tastes as if it was poured from its tub into a pan, heated through, and then trotted out to sit on its warming table. If you're determined to stuff mass quantities of food down your gullet, this will probably do the job. If you have the food sensitivity that gives stomach cramps in response to one or another cheap fat or filler, don't even walk in the door. There's fast food elsewhere in the parking lot that'll fill you up for half the price and a fraction of the misery.

The iced tea has no flavor that would confirm it's anything other than maybe used dish water, so I suppose I shouldn't complain about lack of refills. Lack of knives is more of an issue if you're recklessly served yourself a slice of ham, but. . . don't. It should be impossible to eff up buffet ham, but the ham was tasteless, with a bizarre gummy texture. After that, I was not about to try the sushi.

High points for food were the spicy squid whatevers, the breading-and-fish concoctions in assorted seashells (those have to be pretty awful before I don't think they're adorable), and the fake tiramisu squares (standard buffet fare but this was a fresh batch).",2,"[u' absolutely identical', u' cheap fat', u' fast food', u' bizarre gummy', u' fresh batch']",1.5,"[u' stale fortune', u' other mediocre', u' pretty awful', u' fake tiramisu']",-1.6875

jKBFjNTbiafSdunQy6dlQ,"So, on Christmas day I was doing the traditional fanfair of eating chinese and going to a movie.  I ended up skipping the movie, and came here for dinner instead. I've driven by this place plenty, since its a few miles south of where I live.  I've never eaten here before, but stopped in yesterday to grab some dinner.

Upon entering, I found the prices to be fair.  $9.99 for an all you can eat chinese buffet with a decent variety of food.  I surveyed the buffet area and grabbed my share of food.  Here's some of what I found while dining here.

They had a selection of some sushi, mexican food and tons of chinese food.  They had a decent selection of soups, and I went with the egg drop soup. Hot, tasty, and went down oh so good.  Had some sushi, and that was okay. Not the best, but seemed to get the job done.  Skipped the mexican and went right for the chinese food. I sampled a few dishes, and all were pretty tasty.  Orange chicken, sweet and sour chicken, Lo Mein noodles, all good.

I think they even have alcoholic beverages for sale! I saw some booze on the back wall, but I didn't order any. Pretty neat that they sell booze!

The downer? Desert section was aweful! Not only was there a crap selection, but it was hit beyond belief.  Most of the trays were all but gone and picked over when I was there.  Selection was seriously limited to putting, some very dry and bad tasting cake thingys, and some peaches in syrup. I went with the peaches because they had tons of ice cream, and with the weather being cold, I didn't want any ice cream. Desert area was just a fail over all.

Not the best buffet, but not the worst. Food was okay, prices were fair, and there was a decent amount of seating.

The food: Lots of choices, but not everything is good. No sesame chicken, no general tso chicken and no egg rolls! Only spring rolls and a few simple chicken dishes. They do have 5-6 soups, a good salad bar and fresh Mongolian BBQ. Lots of the things on the menu made me question why they were there on a chines buffet (french fries and cheesy spinach?). The food was very fresh though, but it may have been a product of how busy it was. Dim Sum was undercooked  (still very pink and soft) and that's not good for pork. 

The service: It was packed when I went, but it seemed reasonable for a buffet... I wasn't there for table service and wine suggestions. 

Headache: This place had a very long wait. Probably 40 people were waiting to be seated when we left at 2pm on a Sunday. Children were throwing food and climbing all over the place. Very irritating.

No rice cooker?  The white rice is put into a smallish bin that's usually low in supply.  The fried rice has an artificial look about it (bright colors?) and doesn't have much in the way of taste.

My experience in the business prompts me to live by one very important standard, Tip your server.

To Insure Proper Service = TIPS

That in mind, I gave Miss Amy a five dollar tip upon receiving my Diet Pepsi. From that point on, my table was kept clean and free of mounding dishes. My cup never went below half empty. The selection of food was enormous and for the Holliday price of $10.99, wow, what a deal. Based on the quality of the food, the selection and the attentiveness of my server, I would gladly pay $14-15 for the experience.

I don't know if it's brought out more regularly or just made with love but it's soooo good! Among my favorites are the dim sum, meatballs, honey chicken, spicy chicken, and pizza. Yes, I said pizza. I don't know why but I would almost go here just to eat the pizza! So good and cheesy with just a little sauce! Mmm Mmm Mmm!

The reason I gave it 3 stars is because of the atmosphere. Now don't get me wrong, I know that a buffet isn't going to be the most classy environment. It's clean and well kept but it is really loud and every time I have been there, there are kids literally running around all over the place.

The stir fry part is actually is prepared with many sauces that a cook mixes for you instead of one bottled like sauce taste.

 Lots of variety with different proteins and many stir fried pans, most dishes had decent flavor but many had too much oil.

Best dishes might be the Oyster Mushrooms.... or the pork dumplings?

Quality varies depending on your visit and also part of pan you pick from.

But BEWARE! of the Escolar and take only a bite or you will have problems in your pants. (see Escolar on Wikapedia it's banned in Italy for that reason) Escolar should never be on a buffet. (I already knew that)

Donuts are cinnamon sugared.

Also, this place does not have very much going for it as far as deserts go. They serve cakes that were obviously pre-packaged or frozen. No soft-serve machine, just regular ice-cream (which I'm not a fan of). And the fruit they serve isn't the best quality.

I don't expect great food at a Chinese buffet, but this stuff was below my meager tipping point. The sushi was not rolled tight enough - fell apart too easily. The honey chicken was little cubes swimming in a horrible sauce with lots of canned pineapple chunks. Sauce was thin and I couldn't detect any honey in it. 

When I first approached the buffet, they just dumped some fresh fried fish in the pan. I jumped on that. Too bad, since the fish inside had no flavor, the crust was a big shell surrounding a small piece of fish, and the whole thing was greasy. 

Spare rib chunks had no flavor, and had bits of cartilage that are not familiar to me in pork ribs - maybe it was water buffalo. 

And finally, the thing they called peanut butter chicken was just gross. One strip I couldn't even get my fork to cut through it. And greasy! 

Waited forever for my check. Was ignored for twenty minutes, even though my plates had be taken and I told her I didn't need any more water. She finally brought the check when I was paying. Should have just walked out.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"As a former Atlanta resident and a forever lover of the South and all its delicious food, racist people and humid weather it has to offer- it was my absolute pleasure to bring my friend to his first ever Chicken & Waffle meal.

Although the Scottsdale location is closer to my house, I insisted on my 25min drive to downtown Phoenix to eat at this Lolos because I refused to eat C&W at a place surrounded by floppy hats, leftover nightclub makeup and eating disorders. I wanted Southern-ghetto-fabulous and damnit,  I got it. And even though we showed up at 1 for brunch, we were still faced with a line literally out the door and almost around the block... yet we still put our name down and waited. The place is quite big so even with a large wait list our wait was still only 20mins- not too terrible. As we waited outside and got closer to the entrance, we kept admiring the people that came out with their to-go box, holding their stomachs and making jokes about being so full that they'll roll down the hill. ""Thats what I want to be like!"" I cried, super giddy with excitement. 

We got seated soon enough and we already knew what we wanted (obviously we spent our time outside planning out our meal). Between the two of us we ordered: Chicken and waffles (duh), Fried & smothered pork chops with mac and cheese, green beans and corn bread, fried green tomato appetizer and a giant mason jar of purple kool aid.

As our feast arrived, I could feel my heart beating faster and my arteries clogging up. This was going to be a challenge worth fighting for. We started with the C&W and each put a half-waffle and half-chicken on our plate. My friend starts eating the chicken and I immediately go in a panic. ""What are you doing! No! That's not how you eat it!"". After giving him a long and passionate sermon, I bring a random server to our table to reinforce my lecture about the correct way of eating C+W. The server agrees:

************You grab your waffle. Add a layer of honey/syrup on top of every square of your waffle. You place your chicken ON TOP (either cut-up or whole). You cover the chicken with hot sauce. You grab your knife and fork (OR fold the waffle like a taco) and YOU EAT A BITE OF EVERYTHING AT ONCE************ 

As he took his first bite I swear I saw unicorns and rainbows come out of his eyes. He finally got it. The sweet, salty, spicy, crunchy, soft, fried goodness that is a well-executed C+W. Its sweaty redneck sex on a plate. Its fucking good.

After that, you could've given us a flaccid french fry and we would have still called it a successful meal. The cornbread was amazing, the mac and cheese was tasty and the pork chop was the size of an overweight chihuahua. The only thing not worth ordering was the damn fried green tomatoes: only 4 slices for $7, completely covered in salt, with a side of salt and some extra salt to go with it. Half-way through the meal we found ourselves surrounded by 3 servers and the chef, all gathered to answer the ""what are gizzards made of?"" question- all because they were afraid that we would be grossed out by the definition. We were all cracking jokes and enjoying their company.

As we were down to 1 fried green tomato and half a porkchop left, we started breathing heavily. ""I don't think I can eat any more"" said one person. ""WE MUST FINISH THIS"" said, well, me. Using every bone in my body to be able to eat the last couple bites, we took the nasty green tomatoes in a box and called the whole thing a victory.

I've never had chicken and waffles before - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken (waffles are OK), but wanted to try it out at least once.  This seemed like a good place to go....although I had a feeling the place was going to be overrated. 

While I don't know the Phoenix area well, the restaurant seemed to be located in the industrial boonies - the street looked a bit sketchy, and there was this ghettoish sign painted on a building pointing you to the way of Lo-Lo's.  There was plenty of street parking, and I don't recall seeing a parking lot.  It's a cute looking shop - shaped like a tiny house decorated with some neon lights.  

The place is small - I recall about 6 or 7 tables and the restaurant had most of the tables occupied on a Friday night.  Definitely not a place for big groups unless you want to take over the entire restaurant.  It's a casual spot - waiter service is casual as well.  You don't have a dedicated waiter - they have 2 or 3 people on staff to help the customers as needed (which makes sense for such a small place).

I'm not quite sure why, but it took us a little while to order - there were a decent amount of items on the menu, but because the menu items were mainly combinations of the same thing, we were confused on what/how to order.  For our party of 3, we ended up ordering (I think):  Baby Ray ($13 or 12), Lo-Lo's ($12 or 11), and Stupid Fries ($8).  This place should really be a $$ rating vs. $ - our total bill including tax ended up to be a bit over $40 including tax & tip.  This was just for 2 entrees and 1 appetizer.

Food came in a reasonable amount of time - probably about 10 to 15 minutes.  Portions were reasonably sized - not too big or small.  We had 5 or 6 pieces of chicken and 4 or 5 waffles to share.  The chicken was OK - I didn't find anything special about it.  Meat was tender and the crust was OK.  It helped adding some hot sauce and vinegar to help enhance the flavor.  Waffles were OK - could have been a bit better if the outside was crispier.  

Overall, this place was OK - it wasn't exactly a place to rave home about.  One of the people at our table compared it to Roscoe's and said it was about the same or Roscoe's was a bit better.",3,"[u' huge fan', u' good place', u' quite sure', u' reasonable amount', u' hot sauce']",2.05,"[u' casual spot', u' small place', u' little while']",-0.9375

I read all these great reviews, my mouth was watering and saved my appetite.  I was REALLY disappointed.  We arrived there at 12:00pm on a Tuesday afternoon.

Items we ordered

*2 chicken wings w/waffle
*2 drumsticks w/red beans and rice
*fried okra
*greens
*red velvet cake
*1/2 tea and 1/2 sweet tea

Oh the chicken.....................not crispy and NO flavor!!  Like another reviewer said, ""my mom makes better fried chicken""  - I couldn't agree with her more!  I was thinking about Popeye's chicken while eating this one.  Missing the crispiness and flavors.

The waffle was very good.  Had a hint of cinnamon.

Red beans and rice tasted like it someone opened a can of baked or chili beans and poured it over rice.  Popeye has won over this one too.

Thank goodness for the greens!!  They were tender and DELISH!!!!  But is it worth driving there to get greens.... i dunno...

The coating on the fried okra was hard.

Oh Noooo..... the red velvet cake was the WORST!!!  If there is Red Velvet cake at an establishment, I'll always try it.  I was sooooo disappointed with this one. I only took two bites and had to push it away.  It was too dense and it tasted like there was tons of oil in it.  The cake didn't have flavor, just red.  The frosting was waaay too sweet.  Try Tammie Coe's instead.   

I grew up on Southern food and this place was not tasty at all.

When we were seated, our server greeted us in a timely manner. We asked for some help since it was our first time and he did a fine job letting us know what was popular and pointed us to certain things I asked about. I asked him to go ahead and get our drinks while we decide what we wanted to get.

He came back and asked if we were ready and we said that we were. We placed our order (Number 3, which is 3 pc chicken with two waffles, and a chicken strip basket with fries and a side of corn bread) and then he asked ""So what did you guys want to drink, again?"" Wait a minute. I thought we had already given him our drink order and instead of coming with them, he came and asked what we wanted. That was a tad annoying. 

Our order was brought out by a lady who didn't really acknowledge us. Basically ""who had this or that"" and placed them in the center of the table anyway. She just left without saying a word or asking if we would like anything else. Right away, we noticed we had gotten everything except for our corn bread. We waited for our waiter to make his rounds but he didn't come back. It took awhile but he came to seat someone else so the couple seated at the table next to us got his attention and said that they were missing a few items from their order. So we weren't the only ones. 

After a few trips back and forth to them because he kept forgetting things they were asking for, I got his attention and said that we were missing corn bread. He said he would bring them out. I saw him a few times after that helping other customers and that's fine but he came back to our table and asked how we were doing...without our corn bread. I had to remind him again that we needed corn bread. We were almost done with our meal by this time.

After he finally brought it to us, he started coming around a little more. At that point, I wasn't sure whether or not if it had slowed down or not. I figured it did since he was coming around some more. It was kind of too late, anyway.

When it came time to bring us our bill, he had to ask us what we had ordered today. I was surprised... He said they had misplaced our order. How does that even happen? I've never heard of such a thing...EVER. I should have just told him that service was lousy and since they had lost our order stub, I didn't have to pay for the food. But since I did eat it (cause I was hungry mind you) and possibly a little too understanding, I gave him my entire order again.

So we paid and started leaving and I saw that it was as packed as ever. Worse than when we had arrived. I didn't understand why he would have time to keep checking on us at the end of the meal as opposed to during the meal. Now, I do understand that he may have been new or may even have been too slammed but shouldn't waiters and any establishment at the very least come by and ask if you were doing okay? IDK but the service wasn't on par with some other little restaurants I've been to. 

As for the food, to me it really wasn't anything special. The chicken wasn't like how they make it out to be and the waffles were still kind of dough-y. I may have gone at a bad time but it's a restaurant and they should be consistent. The chicken strips weren't too bad and the best part of the meal was the fries.

Before going to Lo-Lo's there are a few things you should know...
1. This is not a place to go when on a diet or attempting to make healthy choices. You CAN eat healthy here (egg whites and turkey bacon anyone?) BUT it's no fun!!! Why eat egg whites when you can eat grits oozing with butter, crispy always fresh fried chicken, and waffles drenched in sticky syrup? Splurge here, it'll be worth it.

Waffles are the best I've had. The saltiness of the butter mixed with the sweetness of the syrup is literally to die for. (Drooling typing this out tbh)

What we had: 

fried chicken- this was the best I have ever had..it was juicy and flavorful and the skin crispy and delicious

fired catfish: The Best!! wonderful flavor and perfectly cooked

beans over rice- tasted just like homemade, it was really good, did need a little salt though

mac-n-cheese- yummy..not the best I have had, but still good

cornbread- absolutely perfect and buttery

sweet tea- this was the best part of the meal and they gave us a to go cup so we could take it with us

SERVICE- very welcoming from the time we opened the door until the time we left...they all seem to work together and we were very well taken care of

I met up with some friends on Sunday morning. We had to wait about 25 minutes but they have a nice seating area on their patio so it was fine.

After we were seated the first thing we ordered was Kool-Aid. Red. This is the sweetest Kool-Aid I've ever had. They must use twice the sugar. But it is so good and it goes so well with the chicken and waffles. I always get the Tre Tre's - 2 drumsticks and a waffle. They really do have the best fried chicken in town and when you get some of the maple syrup on the chicken, it's just the best thing ever.

My friends ordered a croquette to have as a side and it was disappointing. For $4 it was pretty small, and they only got one. It was not really worth it. Go for the mac and cheese instead!

And just bask in the culinary amazing-ness that is fried chicken and waffles. That's right, I just said bask in reference to breakfast foods. 

Lo-Lo's is no ordinary breakfast fare; it can be enjoyed any time of the day. I prefer it after a few stiff drinks, when my cravings become insatiable. But let's get down to business:

Get the ""red"" kool-aid to drink. It's a little sweet, and I usually water mine down a bit. It's much better than the lemonade which is really tart. 

I like the Tre-Tre for my main entree because it comes with two legs that are good to da bone and very easy to manage. 

For sides, because I am like a ravenous animal at Lo-Lo's, I get the mac and cheese and cornbread. The mac and cheese is out of control delicious. It has baked cheese on top, and it is super creamy underneath the hard shell. I feel like a barnyard pimp when I eat the cornbread because of the large portion. It is very moist as well (I usually put a little syrup from the waffles on it.).

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"To some people, myself included, the concept of chicken and waffles originally sounded absolutely ludicrous. Then you try it and immediately realize that you still have much to learn in life.

I've always been a big fan of LoLo's for many reasons. First, above all else, their fried chicken is top notch in terms of quality and consistency. In fact, their fried chicken is so good, that it beats out a handful of more upscale joints that shamefully charge more money for an inferior product. Make no mistake, Lolo's does chicken extremely well!

The waffles, on the other hand, are just okay. I'd describe them as soft and flimsy, with a slight cinnamon flavor to them. They're not quite as good as some of the waffles offered at local breakfast joints, but I suppose they're passable.

I've tried several sides over the last few years, including grits, mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese. All are pretty well done and reasonably priced. Their menu, featuring various ghetto call-outs, is quite amusing, even though I'll probably never try most of the stuff myself. Their cornbread used to be my favorite of all the sides. It's still very good, but they recently changed the recipe that now includes actual corn kernels inside. This is a matter of personal preference, but I much prefer the old way.

I insist on ordering Kool Aid. Perfect for an intense sugar high, it's the same classic stuff that will permanently stain your clothes and temporarily dye your upper lip - just like the old days!  

We've always wanted to try the desserts here, but we're just so damned full after our meals, that we couldn't possibly order anything else.

So after waiting a few long minutes, my main feast arrived.  Where do I start? Ah, good old chicken leg, nice, small and manageable.  Done! Time for my double layer waffles topped with creamy, melty butter.  ""That's money!"" borrowing a gleeful phrase Guy Fieri always says in his Food Network show, D, D, and D. :)

So my two other pieces were the breast and thigh.  I knew what I was getting into so I carefully avoided the glistening, crunchy evil they call: the skin.  But I did have a little and it was packed with all the great tasting herbs and spices that make up this Southern style cuisine.  That is what makes it distinct from your mainstream chains.

Now, the battle between the chicken and waffle, I give the waffle a slight edge.  Its not the thick kind you might expect, but its still pretty good.

Everything from the atmosphere to their coffee to the service was awesome. Minor slight was that they did not serve decaf coffee, but no big deal. I ordered a waffle with two drumsticks and both were cooked to perfection. It's a pretty good sized waffle too, and the chicken just compliments it so well. Even the syrup on the waffle was delicious. My dad ordered bacon and eggs and he said they were cooked just the way he wanted them. Only other minor slight was that the dishes are commonly served with a side of grits and you can't substitute it for fruit or a biscuit. Still, not big enough of a deal to detract from the overall experience.

The waitresses were all so nice. They came around and refilled out coffee and waters promptly, made sure the food tested well, they even put on the Steelers game on the TV that was close to our table, which we appreciated. And the cold drinks get served in Mason jars, which is so cute. I love it when restaurants do that.

It can crowded, especially during brunch/lunch hours. My family and I went when it first opened at 9 a.m. By the time we left around 10:30, there was a line out the door for lunch. If you go for lunch, get there around 10. But even if you get there late, it's definitely worth the wait.

When our name was called, the hostess (speaking a mile a minute) said we had to sit at a ""two-fer"" or outside.  Mind you it was about 90 degrees.

and felt like). Her tone was totally unprofessional.

The waffle was small and just blah. Not bad...not good. My fiance had chicken, catfish, fries and mac n cheese. His fries were undercooked and it was visible. He said the fish was good but also a tad undercooked. He said the mac n cheese tasted like it was missing something.  Overall, I'd give the food a C.

The area looks a little sketchy, but maybe only because I've always gone after it's already dark out. I've been here three or four times and they have never disappointed! Someone has been outside the door greeting every time I have visited. Even when we had to wait to be seated, we were given menus to look over while we waited. They are always busy and with good reason!

My family came to visit, and I wanted to take them to Lo-Lo's for dinner. We all tried a little of each other's foods to sample different plates. I always get Chyna's Honey Hots. Six big wings served with ranch. There has always been a lot of leftover honey hot sauce even after I've finished eating, so they definitely aren't lacking on the sauce. They have a great flavor to them, and they're always very hot temperature wise and have a zing flavor wise.

We ordered the South Side Chili Cheese Fries which was a MUCH bigger serving than I had anticipated. There were 6 of us eating the fries with our meals and we still had leftover food AND fries. The portions are very generous. 

We all loved the waffles and various styles of chicken. One person at my table ordered the SoulFood Platter of Chicken Fried Chicken which is chicken covered with white sausage gravy. This was also great. It came with a piece of cornbread and 2 sides. One of those sides were string beans and red potatoes. This was probably my favorite side that I've tried so far. They are much spicier than I would have imagined. So much flavor, I loved this side! The grits were also good for the side order. The regular fried chicken was also very tasty. 

The prices are a tad on the high side, but well worth it for the portions and taste you get out of it. The restaurant is also VERY clean. VERY, VERY clean. I don't think I can even stress that enough. Not even a spec of dust on the picture hanging by our table. And the staff has always been amazing. Our bill for 6 people was between $80-90, which wasn't too bad considering the amount of food we had leftover and shared the massive plate of chili cheese fries along with our individual entrees.

After waiting over an hour for food (while every table around us was quickly seated and fed) we finally asked to speak to a manager since our waitress hadn't come back in at least 30 minutes. The manager came out just long enough to see which table we were and then disappeared into the back. Our food came out immediately after, but the chicken was overcooked, the eggs were overcooked, and the portion for their $4 okra side was TINY (maybe ten pieces).  When we asked our waitress what happened she had no apologies only excuses, and the manager never came out to apologize either. In the end they did give us a slight discount but it didn't even cover one of the meals we waited so long for.

OMG... I think perhaps I am in a food coma as I type this review... not sure what more I can add that the other 75 reviews haven't covered, but I'll give it a shot!

We went to Lo-Lo's today after the Phoenix 10k.  There was a group of 7 of us total and we arrived around 10:30am.  We were told there would be a 30 minute wait (which was pretty accurate).  Some of us went in and filled up drink cups with Kool Aid, Lemonade, Iced Tea or a combination - the sugar totally held us over!

We studied the menu as we waited so we all knew what we were going to order before we sat down.  Rasheeta was our waitress and she was awesome - there were a few other guys helping her out as well.  I had the ""Nay Nay's"" which came with 2 waffles, 2 eggs (i ordered them over easy), and grits.  Oh, and I ordered a side of fried okra as well.  (I figured I may as well go all out 'cause who knows when I'll be back).  The waffles and grits had enough butter on them to feed an army of hungry runners.  I also had a bite of Jared's Fried Chicken.  Everything was delicious...

So much for all of the calories burned during the 10k.  Thanks Lo-Lo's for my fix of Southern Food - it reminded me of the good ol' days I spent in Atlanta!

I was so glad that my job was sending me back to Phoenix this month so I could once again experience this place! Imagine my surprise when I arrived in a taxi cab and the place was totally renovated! I mean it's larger, more modern looking and even has a patio. I was worried that the food might not be the same, but it was even better than I remembered. The menu is so extensive and everything looked and sounded good. I decided on 3 pieces of chicken, grits, scrambled eggs with cheese and onions and of course 2 waffles...oh and I had to add a salmon croquette. My coworkers got some of the same things along with fried catfish, mac and cheese and potato salad. We all enjoyed our food tremendously, but you know what else we loved?? The DRANKS! We started out with the Lemonade/Ice Tea mix, then moved on to the Blue Kool Aid and Lemonade mix. My coworker then got a Red, Grape Koolaid and Lemonade mix! Gosh how I love this place. Our server Carlos was awesome, so personable and stayed on top of everything we needed. The one last thing that made this place so awesome and made the dining experience one of the best was the music. Whatever Pandora station they have on rotation or whoever made their playlist is ON POINT! I was grooving the whole time I was eating, two my most favorite things in life, good food and good music.

Ate a little piece of it today, days later I might add and this is after I traveled back to the East Coast with it in my carry on (it's been in the fridge in between travelling time) and it definitely meets my expectations.

my family of 8 adults and 2 children arrived at the restaurant at 1:30 pm on 1/2/13.  we were told the wait was going to be 25 minutes.  we didn't mind because we have always had an awesome experience in the past.  well, 30 minutes goes by and i check in with the hostess desk.  i asked what the hold was.  zoe, the hostess said that we have a large party so it will take longer.  totally understandable.  the hostess was not trying to accommodate for our large party by saving single tables in an area to be combined together.  so smaller party's were being seated before us.  so finally,  zoe the hostess, caught on and started saving tables to accommodate our party.  50 minutes later we were finally sitting down.

we ordered our drinks and meals at the same time.  it took 20 minutes to get our drinks.  it took an additional 25 minutes to get our meals.  the food was great!

i'm not bitching for bitching sake.  the expanded building is nice and we are happy for the business owners but something was lost.  we didn't have that hometown feel.  we miss all the signatures and pictures.  we miss sitting by the fountain drink machine and bathrooms all in the same room.  lol.  our server didn't make us feel welcomed.  our family members have been in the food business and they were up in arms with what we experienced.  it seemed like the servers don't have the experience to handle a larger restaurant experience.

4$ for a side of home fries (that weren't even cooked all the way).

15$ for a 3 piece two waffles and 2 eggs... Over Medium eggs ordered, sunny up came out. Also chicken was extremely bland... Popeye's Chicken is better and cheaper.

3.50$ for a mason jar of cool aid. 

20$ for appetizer sampler.. Pickle chips sooo deep fried couldn't taste the pickles, and breading on fried green tomatoes was VERY bland.

15$ shrimp Mac and cheese.. So salty was barely edible and the shrimp was rubbery. 

Complained to waitress (when flagged her down, she didn't even check up on us for over 40 minutes) she provides us with 4 coupons for ""free cool aid""...

I definitely think this is the best fried chicken that I've ever had. Also quite enjoy the excellent waffles with it. While I'd heard of the pairing, I'd never tried it prior to going to Lo-Lo's. Just works for me. 

I also ended up with 3 mason jars of Kool-Aid, which I love. As the Mrs. and her visiting friend are from Australia, they are not familiar with Kool-Aid. When it came out they said ""red cordial""! Me not being familiar with this red cordial didn't know what that meant. I guess in Australia red cordial has a bad rep for inducing hyperactivity. Of course there is the sugar but then they also think the red food coloring contributes. Since we really did not need our 4 year old and 2 year old more hyper, I ended up with theirs as well. Fine with me. I will admit that I did not finish all 3. Those mason jars are huge!

The rest of the group, kids included, also love their meal.

Among us we had several different pieces of chicken (breast, thigh, wing), waffles, grits, collard greens and mac & cheese. Pretty much everything was a hit. The ladies absolutely loved the collard greens and we put away about 3 orders among the 5 of us. The mac & cheese (a JW recommendation) was also a very big hit. We also modified our grits order to no butter (not sure if that is sacrilege) and while I don't know if my mouth enjoyed it quite as much, I didn't feel like I was going to die from richness as I'd felt after the previous visit.

After finishing the Phoenix 10K this morning, our group decided that Lo Lo's would be the perfect place to undo all of the health gains we had made. Little did I know that I would be undoing an entire year's worth of morning jogs. It was the sort of experience that makes you wonder if you should consult a cardiologist.

Three (3!) pieces of fried chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs w/ cheese and onions. I figured if I was going to eat at Lo Lo's, I was going to go for it. 

The food came pretty quickly. The first thing that struck me were the two enormous globs of butter (1 in my grits and 1 on my waffles).

The naive inner-workings of my brain caused by the culinary repression in the East Valley were so wrong.  So so wrong.  I will never forget the day I went to Lo-Lo's.

Sometimes when you combine two unexpected foods together you reach this special nirvana that you never thought possible.  For some people it is chocolate and bacon (tried that in a cupcake and did not like it) and for me, I reached the ultimate bliss with chicken and waffles.  May the clouds part and the gods sing hallelujah.

When the husband and I went, we tried to keep it traditional and ordered some fried chicken, some waffles, some mac and cheese, and some cornbread.  Lo-Lo's clearly believes in the mantra that butter is better.  Everything is loaded with it, and I love it.  The mac and cheese was intensely buttery and creamy, with just the right amount of ""mush"" in the macaroni to make it down home and comforting.  The chicken is crispy, crunchy, greasy and flavorful... exactly as it should be.  The waffles are thin, soft and buttery with a hint of spice.  The thin and piping hot maple syrup was served along with the waffles.  I found the best way to combine everything is to shred your chicken as best as you can, sprinkle it on top of your super-buttered waffles, douse it in syrup, and then dive in.  One bite of this and you know what I am talking about.

There is nothing wrong with this place.  It's hectic and loud with the cooks and servers yelling at each other, but it's comforting and peaceful in it's own special way when your server smiles and hands you your mason jar full of soda.  You want authentic?  Go here, and you can't go wrong.

The wait time to get into the restaurant was reasonable and they do offer a nice outside lounge to wait at but it went downhill from there. 

Our table of five was placed in the COOP room. The acoustics of that room made it incredibly loud. The surfaces are all hard, the sound of the metal chairs scratching against the concrete reminds one of nails on chalkboard, but that's ok. It's part of the vibe. The AC was icy though, perhaps because we were under the vent. Our server was quick and pleasant and the drinks arrived promptly.

We mainly ordered some variation of fried chicken and associated sides with one of our party ordering the shrimp and grits.  Forty-five minutes later (the magic of texting and time stamps) the food came. There was no unprompted check in to explain why the wait was so long. When the food arrived we were told it was the shrimp and grits, almost like it was our fault for ordering it. 

The taste of the food was OK. The shrimp and grits were hot but it seemed that the chicken had sat waiting for the last of the order to be completed. The waffle was warm and the corn muffins outstanding. The rice in the dirty rice was not fully cooked and the mac and cheese had congealed during the wait. 

I'm sure our experience would have been better had the food been hot and arrived more promptly or at least with some apology.

Well, one coworker left the company before they made their goals, so they went there with a third coworker for her going away lunch.

They were a little curious where they were being taken when they ended up in the middle of nowhere in a not-so-great neighborhood.  They found a parking spot after 5 minutes of driving around, u-turns, and backing up.  They walked into the small house and got a seat in the very back on the side seating area.  The place was packed.

Two ordered a water and lemonade and the third went for the sweet tea.  It was SO sweet and SO good.  The jar they brought it in seemed enough for the whole table, but somehow she managed to take it down without a problem.

She ordered Tre-Tre's (2 chicken legs and a waffle) and a side of Mac n' Cheese.  They also split two cornbread muffins between the three of them.  They took a late lunch and waited a little while for their order so by the time it arrived, they were ravenously hungry and dug right in to the grub.  They didn't talk to each other for five minutes except to comment on the food and ask one another if they had tried it all yet.  The chicken was juicy and crunchy.  The waffles were soft and topped with buttery syrup goodness.  The mac n' cheese was creamy and rich.  The cornbread was fluffy and delicious.

After the initial feeding frenzy took place, they began to slow down.  It began getting hotter and hotter, but they kept eating, drinking, and sweating.  It was glorious!  The server came with the bill and the gluttonous ladies were so full and in a food haze they could barely explain how to split the check.  They sat for a while before they were able to leave and finally made their way back to work.  They proceeded to dream all day about the chicken, waffles, mac n' cheese, cornbread, sweet tea, lemonade, and all the goodness they consumed in less than 20 minutes.  Some of the women were more comfortable for the remainder of the day based on their wardrobe choices.  Everyone else was none the wiser.  All that was left to do was plan their next trip to Lo-Lo's and also the sister restaurant Mrs. White's Golden Rule.

The End.

The moral of the story:  Wear big pants with an elastic waist and order everything that looks good.",5,"[u' sweet tea', u' SO good', u' dug right', u' so full', u' sweet tea', u' more comfortable']",2.485714286,"[u' small house', u' late lunch']",-0.55

I'm not sure how to sum it up except just a fun little place with great food! The waffles and homefries were my favorite (not much of a fried chicken person, but someone with me said it was good).

Thankfully I was meeting a few locals that knew to call in ahead to make a reservation, otherwise we would have had to wait a long while for a table. Though the restaurant is quite small, rather a ""whole-in-the-wall"" type of joint, I have to say the service was pretty excellent. The food servers were quick and to the point, no wasting time kind of service. I was in a party of 20 and our food orders came out within a few minutes and they are generous with their portions. I personally ordered the ""Tre-Tre"" (2 drumsticks and 1 waffle) and added a side order of 2 eggs scrambled and a side order of corn bread. The menu prices are inexpensive too! Major Plus!

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"After I flew back into town my husband and I decided to go here for lunch, since it was close to the airport and the food was excellent (up until this visit) 
I ordered biscuits with the chicken gravy, my husband had chicken and waffles and we got a banana pudding to go. 
We got home and we both felt kind of off, nothing major. Then around 6pm we decided to eat the banana pudding that we got earlier, yes it was refrigerated the whole time. Maybe a half hour after that I was bent over a toilet puking my guts out and dry heaving. This continued the whole night and I had to call in sick at my job. I ended up going to urgent care because it was so bad. There was really nothing they could do but give me anti nausea medication and make sure I wasn't dehydrated. I had full blown food poisoning. 
Here's the part that makes me not want to EVER return here; my husband called the establishment and asked for the manager, when he told the manager I had food poising and was really sick, HE HUNG UP.  So instead of saying he'd look into it or he would check the batch of pudding or gravy , HE HUNG UP. Really good customer service right there. Not to mention how sketchy that is for not owning up and being professional about it. 
So we called the Heath department and they said there have been multiple cases of food poisoning in the area.... 
This was the only meal I had eaten that day, so I know it wasn't something else. I won't ever come back to this location, and I'm cautions about the ones in better neighborhoods.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,I went to Lo-Lo's for the first time last night and all I have to say is that it will definitely not be the last time we'll be going.  Not only was the food delicious but also the service was pretty great. The only thing is that since we went on a pretty busy night specially since a lot of prom groups seemed to be there the service wasn't very quick to get to us.  Our server had a lot of parties going in and out and it seemed he forgot about is for a minute but he apologized profusely and was very nice and courteous throughout the night.  I only got a small serving since I'd had a pretty late lunch but it left me wanting more at the end of the night. The waffles were my favorite but that's probably because I prefer sweets rather than savory foods. The serving sizes are great and the drinks were right to my liking.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"We came here for the first time. We are from California, so we compare all chicken and waffles to Roscos. Needless to say, they were way better. The waffles are delicious and the chicken is very flavorful. My only complaint was the service. We got our drinks in a timely fashion. Appetizers came out 20 mins after receiving our drinks but when we got our entrees it was a whole different story. It was 3 of us. They brought out 2 of the 3 entrees and said my food was on the way. 5 mins went by. Then 10 and I still didn't have my food. Finally I got my order. My 2 other friends were more than half the way done. Also, my order was only partial. I ordered the #9 (Lil Almadi) or something like that and a side of Mac and cheese. She said my Mac and cheese was coming. I waited and waited and never got the Mac and cheese. She never even checked on us. It's like she completely forgot about us. I tried to flag her down on several occasions to inquire about my Mac and cheese, but she never noticed us. After 45 mins to an hour of just waiting, we finally got her attention and just ask for our check. It wasn't until I told her to remove the Mac and cheese from our check did she even remember. I spent the entire time here worrying and waiting. I never had the chance to relax and enjoy my meal. Even while I was eating, it felt awkward because my other 2 friends were done and they were just waiting for me to finish eating. I don't mind coming here again because I liked the food.

I ordered the chicken and waffles with a side of potato salad and rice and beans. I was initially devastated that they had no candies yams available as I am a huge fan. The chicken was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside but lacked the burst of flavor I was hoping for. The waffles were flavorful but the texture was on the spongy side.

They have a great menu for everyone with any appetite.   I would warn you, this is not a place for those on a diet.  It is great down home, soul food cooking at it's finest.  Order a few things to get a sample, but you obviously have to get chicken and waffles.... they are good, really good.  The chicken was crispy and moist.  The waffle was the size of my plate.  It was light and fluffy.  A little maple syrup... some hot sauce... Heaven I tell you!  I was so happy.

The mac and cheese was good... not great.  The corn bread was dense, but not overly so. The sweet tea was a bit too sweet and needs to be cut.  My wife ordered the salad.  It was delicious.  They were generous with the chunks of fried chicken and other toppings, with a nice portion of mixed greens.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"What a perfect treat after a strenuous cardiovascular workout?! This Phoenix secret is definitely on my list of restaurants to visit again. Just don't eat here too often as the fare is high in carbs and saturated fat. The food is served hot out of the kitchen as soon as it's ready, so there is little wait time. It's a good idea to remember your order number and meal name as the person bringing out the order probably won't be your server. Although the service was rushed, it's what I expected from a busy, family-owned restaurant on a Sunday morning. 

Before a table was clear, I was reminded of waiting outside to be seated at a popular restaurant in New York City in the chilly winter wind and snow, expect it was a warm fall morning and we were definitely not in Manhattan. The decor was minimal, but clean and finding the place took some extra effort (if you are coming from the north on Central its right after Buckeye and there is no sign). For a taste of the Southeast right in the middle of the Southwest, stop in at LoLo's, fo' sho'.",4,"[u' perfect treat', u' good idea', u' popular restaurant', u' warm fall']",2.9,[u' chilly winter'],-0.6

Oh ok, and then when it came to be seated we were told we were not getting seated until entire party was here and by this time 8 of us were there, so I told her call us a party 8 and let's get breakfast going! I have to say though Lo Los was the place for huge parties sat morning, there were 2 other groups of 15 waiting to be seated as well. 

We had 2 servers, a nice young lady and Jaqwan, and let me tell you, both servers were great!  Jaqwan was hot on making sure we were taken care of from drinks to food. Love a place with great service! And yes Lo Los was busy but they never looked or made us feel rushed!

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"My significant other and I came on a busy weekend around lunch time. There was a free valet. The place was packed, so we waited around an hour or so for a table. While we waited, there was a comfy seating area outside and water. 

Once we were seated, we ordered the famous soul food platter to share (where you pick an entree and two sides, and this includes cornbread), along with a red koolaid. We picked the 3 pieces of chicken smothered in gravy & onions for the entree, along with a waffle and mac & cheese for our two sides.

Chicken smothered in gravy and onions:
Maybe it was because I was so hungry by then, but this tasted absolutely delicious. Hot, savory, and crunchy, this chicken lived up to the hype. The chicken was perfectly cooked, and the gravy and onions added a nice salty (but not overwhelming) complement to the crunchy chicken. 

Waffle:
The waffle was great, and also lived up to the hype I expected, as this is one of the signature dishes. It was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The actual size of the waffle looks bigger in photos, probably because the plate is smaller than I imagined, but one waffle is still quite an adequate amount for one person. My SO said this was the best waffle he's ever had. 

Mac & cheese:
This was disappointing. The mac and cheese tasted grainy to me, and the sauce was lumpy rather than smooth. The cheese sauce didn't taste very cheesy to me either. I would not order this again. 

Cornbread:
Warm, slightly sweet, and soft, this cornbread hit the spot. Great supplement to the salty chicken. 

Red koolaid:
This came in a large mason jar and was sweet, but not too sweet, making a refreshing quencher to the savory foods. 

Service:
The complimentary valet was nice, as there were a lot of cars and people around. Our waiter was friendly and prompt with taking our orders, despite the very full restaurant.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Honestly the FOOD WAS PHENOMENAL!!! 

Ok here is the down - low.  Lolo's is known all over and people come here all the time to eat so I expect a wait.  When I got there at 11 am there was an hour wait, I expected that no big deal, and was told by the friendly staff that I can wait outside on the patio if I would like to wait.  Well I walk through the dining area to find at least 4 tables empty and ALL of the outside tables empty!  If you have an hour wait, why are the tables empty? I am assuming they were short staffed but still unacceptable for a place that always has a wait.  After waiting a little over an hour, we get our table.  We literally order our food once we sit down from our waiter Chris.  Chris was really nice and stopped by from time to time to check on us but it took 45 minutes to get our food - just unacceptable.  We literally ordered CHICKEN AND WAFFLES ONLY!  There were no added items, no speacialty items, just the norm.  Also, I noticed there were three tables that sat down after me and got there food before me.  I personally LOVE there food and thus the reason I brought a friend of mine here to eat but waiting 2 hours to eat chicken and waffles is crazy.

It was a bit of a hole in a wall, but the food and service was far from disappointing. :) We went again not too long ago, and they upgraded to a larger building. Of course, the food was still amazing. The koolaid and lemonade is a bit too sweet, even for my taste (which is saying something, because I LOVE sweets), but still good. Oh, but the food.

Betty Boop plate - The Chicken was fried very good there was a good crisp to it. But the inside was so moist. I didn't use the salt shaker so the flavoring was pretty good.

Mac n cheese - Was so creamy and cheesy a hit with everyone at our table.

Cornbread - Sweet and warm worth the try kicking myself for not ordering one to go!

Catfish appetizer - These alone were the best appetizer at our table. Fried perfectly and great flavor. I wish I would of order a double order of this!

Koolade Punch flavor mixed with Lemonade - this was cute and believe it or not refreshing and worth ordering so much so I had a refill!

If I ever make it back to Phoenix. Lo Los Chicken & Waffles is going to be a Must stop for me! If you don't believe me see my pictures  and go try it for your self you will be hooked too!

Fast forward to food, all of our food came out shortly after we finished our appetizer. I everything I had was great. The chicken and waffles were just great together. I had a wing, thigh, and a breast. All were crunchy and moist on the inside. My kids who are hard to please ate every bite of their chicken strips and waffles.

We shared the green bean appetizer to start, and it was quite good.  Crispy, not greasy and the sauce was a great accompaniment.  Have tried their foods a few times and am always impressed with vegetable sides.  Their greens are incredible and I always enjoy the grits.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"I came here with a girlfriend and were told the wait would be 45 min.  

We left for 30 min and came back only to find that we had missed them calling us. AH!

We let the ladies know we were there and they (very sweetly) accommodated us, (probably because we were only two people and fit on a postage stamp).

I did not have the Kool Aid, but an alcoholic beverage at the top of their ""drinks"" menu and it was FANTASTIC. I""m almost positive it had red Kool Aid, vodka and pineapple juice.

I ordered Betty's Boob, a perfect combo to taste their chicken and SCRUMPTIOUS waffle and then ordered Mac & Cheese and Cheese Grits on the side.  

The Betty's Boob was AMAZING.  The waffle was scrumptious and the chicken skin was fabulous.  The meat itself was juicy, but not in the right way.  The interior meat was a little dry, but the outer meat was juicy.  But I'm nitpicking. 

We were told the Mac was amazing, and I will say as a Mac and Cheese aficionado, it was not good.  It was not creamy in any sense, and was definitely more Southern in style as it was Mac you could build with (thick).  Not the creamy type I have come to adore.  

The Cheese Grits were gone in a matter of seconds. I LOVED them.

We also ordered Red Velvet cake at the end, to see what all of the fuss was about and it was BAD.  The driest and least cocoa-y Red Velvet cake I have ever had.  The cream cheese icing is so cloyingly sweet, it almost hurt my teeth going in.  I would like to see their recipe include more oil/egg to give a more moist texture.  

I will say I smelled Collard Greens walking buy me all morning and WISHED I had ordered them instead of my Mac.  I will DEFINITELY order them next time.

Our waitress was AMAZING and when I walked away from my birthday present under the table, a nice guy came up and made sure I didn't leave without it.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Today's lunch adventure: Lo-Lo's chicken and waffles at the Phoenix location. I had to let my food settle before I began writing. I am still in a food coma. I can compare this food coma to being Ryan Lochte for maybe 30 mins, because I feel slow and DUMB- Jeah!  When driving to this place, you better look for it or you will miss it, but it is kind of hard to miss with people surrounding the door waiting to get in. 

We found a parking spot, walked in, gave our name and waited a total of 10 mins. We actually stood outside of the door for a minute or two before we went inside to see if your name was called.  I have been wanting to come to this restaurant for along time now so I am glad I went with my friend Tamirra. She told me to pace myself because if not I will get sick.  I seriously thought by the end of this lunch date I would be sweating grease and my pores would ooze of grease. I order the #9 lil amadi. I order it with 2 thighs and one waffle. It came out in 10 mins and all I can say is Oh my WORD! It was amazeballs.  The chicken skin was crispy and juicy and the waffle could have been in the waffle iron for a tad longer but it wasn't mushy by any means. For the drink, I just ordered a water. There were two girls sitting next to me asking what the kool aid menu was, have you ever imagined asking a server what the koolaid menu was for the day? The server gave the colors and the respective flavors. She named them off: red, blue and purple and then went into the actual flavors tropical punch, blue raspberry and grape.  Classy! :) 

Overall the meal was really good, the service was good as well. The server came probably a handful of times, to give us our drinks, take our order, give us boxes and the check.

The only complaint that I have, which isn't even my problem but apparently they do not allow outside drinks inside of the restaurant. There was a gentleman drinking a starbucks coffee and a server actually stood there and waited for him to take a ""last sip"" before he had to hand it over.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,I don't yelp I've never felt the need to but something this amazing I want to share. Celebrating a birthday and return from the army with my family we decided to go here...whenever my sister is on leave from the army we always go at least once before she reports back. Anyway this is not important what is is the fact that the collard greens were on point today so amazing so good slightly spicier than normal but amazing nonetheless. The catfish out of this world it was crunchy it wasn't murky absolutely perfect! Also important to the story you should know that I literally get paid to taste it is my job I'm a chef. Now here's what happened...I ordered the fried chicken and waffles for my children I tasted a piece of chicken because I noticed that they were not eating it and it tasted like peanut butter. Keep in mind that I am at a table with three adults and three children with one more adult also a chef on the way to join us. Working in the industry I called over my server and I mentioned it to him he went to the manager which is what you're supposed to do they tasted a different piece of chicken and proceeded to come and literally disrespect me in front of my whole family. The general manager told me that not only were my taste buds wrong but I should eat less peanut butter. Seriously eat less peanut butter? Now I sat there shocked but I told him the other adults also tasted the same thing he said they were wrong. Then the manager accuses me of actively looking for something to complain of in my meal to get free things. Keep in mind I didn't even order the chicken which he then mocked me for eating my kids food. I had catfish which I ate all of and it was amazing. Also keep in mind that I still proceeded to spend more money on a dessert and drinks but they decided to freeze out our whole table and we sat and waited for 25 minutes for our bill nobody came. When our other guests came to join no one came to take his order so he shared a water with me and ate the leftover food from the birthday girl. No one even acknowledged us we had to flag down another completely different server or maybe it was a busser to get our tab. I wish I would've recorded his response(manager) to me because it was that outlandish.

I  felt sorry I judged it before i went in. I  ordered the number 9, which was chicken thigh and leg with a waffle. Filled me up just right! the waffles were soooo goood! tasted of cinnamon and the butter was light. 

I also ordered the red velvet cake because i love red velvet and i heard it was the best. SADLY I didn't like it. The moistness was really good, but i thought the velvet would be more rich and the frosting was too cheesy for my liking.

I always have the same thing: The lil' Amati; I have for years. The chicken is always juicy and the waffles are always hot. For add ons I will get the cornbread muffin and the mac n' cheese. 

My husband has tried a variety of dishes: the chicken sandwich, fried zucchini, the steak and egg breakfast, and the salads; he has also had some variation of the chicken and waffles. His favorite is the salad because the chicken is good and he isn't straying too far from his eating plan. 

I love the atmosphere and the food. 

I have read a few reviews from white people complaining about the service at the Phoenix location. I feel like I need to preface what I am about to write: I am not calling anyone a racist or a bigot. I am not one, either. Lolo's tries really hard to meet the needs of its (suddenly) diverse customer base. It will not always hit the mark. If you like the food but are leery about being treated differently because of your perceived ethnicity I have a suggestion: try their Gilbert or Scottsdale locations. Those locations are gentrified versions of this wonderful minority owned eating establishment. Perhaps gentrified is a harsh word. My caucasian husband who grew up on Chicago's south side says, ""White washed."" Ok, that's harsh! However, the non-Phoenix locations are designed and run to appeal to the markets they serve as determined by their geographic location. It is likely people who don't feel comfortable eating on the south side will enjoy the food and the ambiance in Scottsdale or Gilbert.

Let me preface this by saying that I don't usually eat anything fried, but at Lo-Lo's you have to eat something fried if you want to truly immerse yourself in this eating experience.

Then we ventured into the ""Eats"" as they refer to this part of the menu here. I had the redfish with a side of mashed potatoes and greens. GEEZ!

This was one of those places you get excited about because it's soul food in the south.. well not sure if you would call Phoenix the south, but you get the point. 

This place is a solid 3.5 for the food experience, but when I think about round up or round down, the other touches allow me to comfortably nudge this place to a 4.

+Service was amazing. I appreciate other waiters asking do you need anything. Sometimes your server can get caught up and you are left waiting. Equally important, the server had an opinion. The worst thing is when you ask someone about an item and they shrug their shoulders.
+Food came out pretty quickly and nice and warm. I order the mix - fried chicken and a piece of catfish with greens, red potatoes and green beans, and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the fish was tasty, the chicken was better than okay but not great.. and the greens/green beans were just okay. I ordered the red velvet as well and well.. how can you NOT have cream cheese frosting. After letting it sit a day I liked it more.. but something was missing. 
+Mason Jars: Yes, folks, this deserved it's own line. A place totally rocks when they serve your drink in a mason jar! I loved it. If I wanted a sugar rush, I could have ordered the kool-aid. That's awesomeness.

The corn bread muffin was moist, buttery and flavorful. I was so full, but had to try the red velvet, and so glad I did. The cake is so moist and the frosting is perfect; not overly sweet. The only thing to be aware of is that bits of the red cake get stuck between teeth. Looks like those red pills you use to check if you're brushing your teeth correctly (epic fail). I'm just glad I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and noticed my red teeth before heading out to the next event.

Give me a minute to elaborate.
One *expects* a substance fried in grease to be ....greasy. But that's not necessarily the case. You can fry something to a crisp, it can still be juicy/moist on the inside, without being sopping or dripping in grease. 
That said, the chicken wasn't soggy by any means. There was still some crisp to it. I licked my fingers when the meal was done.

A nibble of the cornbread and it tasted like nothing special but nothing abysmal. Oh, there were some dry smothered potatoes.

What else can fill a couple fatasses better than fried chicken, waffles, soda, and kool aid on warm Friday morning at bout 11am.

Yep... Ventured to Arizona's version of Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles and they did not disappoint.

Why Roscoes? Because i love their food. THe waffle is thick, with flavor rather than the crunchy thin crusts that many folks adhere too. There will much comparison to Roscoe because the other chicken and waffle places like Mrs. Bea's kinda suck...

Service:
Stephen was our host and server, and he was great. One of the best servers my limited life has the privilege of experiencing. He was on top of everything, constantly asking if we needed stuff. Keep in mind, it was super hectic at this hour and he just hustled. It got to a point where I can't even ask for anything because he asked first or was bringing it out... At the end of the day, he shaked our hands, and thanked us, and wished us a wonderful time in the 602. I was amazed how excellent the service was. Of course, with the exception to the skinny waiter/host at Roscoes LBC, the service tends to suck pretty bad.

Chicken:
It tasted similar to Roscoe, even the menu had similar attributes. Nice and fluffy. 

Lolo's Hot sauce:
Pretty damn good. Had a nice cajun bite opposed to Tabasco's vinegarette base or the pepperish mexican chiles. 

Waffle:
Decent flavor but not as thick. I didn't particularly care for the waffles too much.

Kool Aid:
LOL sugar and water, what can go wrong? THis day, they had red, blue, and green. Obviously, i indudged in the OG red. Upon asking to try the green, Stephen, asked if I have tried the Suicide. 

Suicide: Bottom was lemonade with blue, green, and red kool aid topped off with sprite. No Mixing!!!! and it was great... Perfect thirst quencher for the Arijona heat...

Overall I was pleased with the overall experience, from the courteous valet dude(s) all the way to the kool aid and bill. 

So far, my time in Arizona was met amazing friendliness. I was a bit concerned with the various news media on hobunk Arizona towns and their disdain for minorities portrayed by all types of media. That shit is so untrue. I love these little country/hicktowns =D

All the country white folks in Arijona, from Buckeye all the way down to whack ass Bisbee was nothing but pleasantry, howdy y'll, smiles, and excellent hospitality.

The first time I ever went there it was wonderful. It was in this small house and the atmosphere and food was amazing with wonderful service. Then they moved.

I work pretty close so one time a coworker and I called in a lunch take-out order. From my prior experience of them being so busy I called well ahead of time to ensure it would be ready when I got there. It wasn't. I waited an extra half an hour and was told it was my fault because I called so early. Rude.

Regardless, the food was amazing and I wasn't going to let that ruin a restaurant for me. Went there once more with my boyfriend and had great food and great service. A few more times had take-out and they were all a success. 

Then my boyfriend and I took two of our friends there for a greasy hangover breakfast since they had never been there before. We were told the wait would be 40 mins. After an hour my boyfriend asked what had happened and they told us we missed it when we were called. Annoying but hey, maybe it was our fault and we sat back down expecting to be first in line. The hostess then came out and seated a group of like six who had gotten there way after us. Annoyed and STARVING we gave up and left. And I looked over at the hostess just livid and she looked right back at me with this smug look on her face.

Today was definitely the last straw. We ordered take-out and apparently they no longer accept payment upon arrival. You have to pay with a card up front. Thankfully I work at a bank and have an ATM on campus so I could deposit the cash into my account for the $70 order we made. They said we needed the card and ID to pick up the order and I told her I was sending someone else to pick it up, the girl on the phone told me she would make an exception as long as he had those two items. And of course they told my coworker when he got there they can't do that but luckily gave him the food. The chicken was dry and tiny and the waffles were super thin.

The menu has an array of different combination options (ex. Lolo's: 3 pieces with 1 waffle, etc.) and you are sure to find the one that best fits your craving. I almost ALWAYS go with the Lil C. It comes with 2 pieces of chicken (legs/thighs) and a side of mac & cheese OR beans. The mac & cheese is a MUST HAVE!! And if you are into gravy and don't mind a .50 extra charge, order your chicken ""smothered"" and your chicken will indeed be smothered with their succulent gravy and grilled onions. In my opinion, this definitely hits the spot! However, during my most recent experience here, I decided to order the salmon croquette for a little change. There are several options for salmon croquette (salad, breakfast plate) but my server helped me decide on the salmon croquette platter which comes with TWO sides AND cornbread! I was so excited that I was able to get my favorite mac & cheese and buttered corn for my 2nd side. I'll be honest that the salmon croquette didn't excite me much. It was a tad dry and not as flavorful as I hoped. A 3/5. But my sides were still wonderful. My mom and I saved room for dessert this time and oh my goodness. Their bread pudding is OH SO GOOD!

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is not my favorite dining establishment.

Publicly, that title is held by a recently-revived casual lunch and dinner spot in Tempe some miles away.  Its fresh, clean, simple dining and college casual environment appeal to the middle class pseudo-foodie in me, and it is to that restaurant that I introduce friends and acquaintances when they ask 'Where should we go for lunch?'  That restaurant is my public gastronomic façade, the place I almost dress up for, and where I know I will always end up, not because I am in love with it and cannot see it for its faults, but because I love it and incapable of comprehending a gustationary existence without it, my culinary spouse, if you will.

Lo-Lo's, however, is my lover.

Lo-Lo's, unlike the sleek, sophisticated, cosmopolitan Other, is the rich and rusticated temptress, a shadowy figure leaning suggestively upon a voluptuous Victorian balcony, or, in this case, against the brown stucco'd brick walls found between 1st and Central Avenues on Yuma Street.  The sharp, gentrificated Other demands poise, an appreciation for the obtuse nomenclature of Mediterranean flavors, and the quiet false dignity of petite bourgeois living: not unlike the maintenance costs of a promised cohabitant.  The artificial, hip vestments, gym membership, etc. all satisfy these demands.  Lo-Lo's, however, accepts me in the moonlight, when I am most exhausted by the petty realities of life, with my most basic of culinary judgments, paunch belly, and dimpled thighs, several of which were caused, in part, by my indulging in Lo-Lo's itself.

The chicken is succulent, always crispy on the outside, and never excessively greasy (if your definition of 'excessive' is based on a reasonable understanding of the genre of food that is served at Lo-Lo's).  The waffles are crispy and delicious, savory rather than sweet, and always served with copious amounts of sweet cream butter and syrup, so that even the most grossly over-indulgent might be satisfied.  The catfish is crusted with a simple cornmeal batter, perfectly seasoned, and juicy on the inside.  It's absolutely delicious with a light (or generous) coating of Louisiana hot sauce.

The majority of the sides are also delectable: the corn bread is served sweet-style, though not overly so.  The fried okra is plump and crispy.  The mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had, and the candy sweets (sweet potatoes) both uncomplicated and complex.  The beans and rice are a meal unto themselves.

The drinks are very sugary, and unless you want to fill up on several hundred calories worth of sweet tea or (virtually opaque) Kool-aid on its own, it might be best to order water.  The lemonade is several rungs below both of those options on the sugary-ness level.

The atmosphere is casual, though not ""kick off your shoes"", casual; some of the staff live in the neighborhood, and they're very friendly and patient with customers.  Lo-Lo himself is often there on Sunday mornings, when the church crowds come to partake in his creations wearing their congregational best.  A Bose stereo in one corner of the smallish hallway/first dining room area often plays Jazz music.  It can get very crowded at virtually all hours, as it is a very popular place.  Plan on pooling your money: they discourage separate checks.  The bathroom is small but very clean and homey.

My lover, however, unlike those mythological places found only in culinary rags and the imaginations of tunnel-visioned food writers, is not perfect.  There is, to a degree, a problem of consistency at Lo-Lo's: those ordering their fried chicken with gravy may sometimes find their meal slathered in a salty, caramel-colored sauce popping with the flavor of roast onions.  Other times one is confronted with a considerably thinner gravy of nearly-raw white rings.  The cornbread, while always delicious, is sometimes dry.  The staff, friendly and generally attentive they may be, is often swamped by the sheer volume of people coming in and out of the dining areas, and it is often difficult to secure seating for large groups.  Don't be afraid to ask for refills on your drinks if necessary.

For all its faults, I find myself unable to draw myself away from Lo-Lo's for any more than a few weeks at a time, like some strange, wonderful addiction that from time to time demands my submission, a temporal span which, I suspect, will rapidly shorten as I surrender more and more often to the need.  My friends and I even crafted a clever neologism to describe the unique sensation of simultaneous joy, victory, disgust and regret that follows most outings to this alluring outpost of gustational heaven and nutritional hell: to get Lo-Lo'd.

In any case, assuming a readiness for all its faults and its aftereffects, I would recommend Lo-Lo's to anyone not currently pregnant, elderly, a child, or stricken with some sort of malady affecting nutritional well-being.",5,"[u' favorite dining', u' reasonable understanding', u' sweet cream', u' absolutely delicious', u' hot sauce', u' sweet potatoes', u' sweet tea', u' very friendly', u' very popular', u' always delicious', u' generally attentive', u' wonderful addiction', u' unique sensation', u' currently pregnant']",7.375833333,"[u' casual lunch', u' casual environment', u' false dignity', u' excessively greasy', u' not perfect', u' often difficult']",-2.65

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"The hype for this place was off the wall!! ""It's better than Roscoe's"" ""They're chicken is soooooo goooood!"" and so on and so on, so whilst on vacation I made my first visit along with the hubby and some family. While I've never had Roscoe's to make the comparison, I have had The Breakfast Klub in Houston and DIED over their delicious chicken, waffles and grits so I was looking to be just as wowed. 

All I can say is, it was all hype. Sorry!!! I know Arizonians everywhere just fell out of their chairs!! It just wasn't amazing, or even kind of good, it was just OK. 

We went on a Sunday morning for breakfast. The service was good, we beat the Sunday church crowd so it wasnt overly packed but I was kind of shocked at the size of place, pretty cramped but I guess I'll give it cozy. 

So we order, I love that the drinks come in HUGE mason jars (not so good for those wasted calories on SUGARY drinks) and get the chicken breast and wing with a waffle and a side of grits. Boooo!!!!! My grits were soup, I had to season them well to get some flavor and despite letting them sit for a little to see if they'd solidify. . . .no go. I was sooooo dissappointed. 

Moving onto the main dish, I dont love chicken skin but I understand the allure in the fried variety so I indulge from time to time. This time I went for it and tasted. . . .salt. Lots of salt. Double booooo!!! The breading was fine, not to thick or gummy when it hit the syrup but still too salty for me. So fried skin removed, chicken doused in hot sauce, I enjoyed the remainder of my dish and ordinary waffle and was thoroughly full but not too satisfied. 

Overall, Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles was just that, chicken and waffles and nothing to spectacular at that. 3 stars for being an ok chicken & waffles joint with good service and decent prices.",3,"[u' delicious chicken', u' so good', u' hot sauce', u' thoroughly full', u' too satisfied', u' good service']",2.7,"[u"" n't amazing"", u' ordinary waffle']",-0.55

Lo-Lo's Chicken & Waffles is the spot to beeeee, when you want something hot, delicious, and savoryyyyy.

Chicken: Juicy, hot, tender, and seasoned well with just enough crunch.
Syrup: Syrup.

We both got the Lo Lo's plate which consisted of 3 pieces of chicken and 2 large waffles.  The food came out quickly and we didn't waste anytime chowing it down.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"My first time trying chicken and waffles, let's see what the hype is about. First of all my big mistake was going there on a Sunday, Palm Sunday to be exact. We were told there would be a 30 min wait, which I was surprised due to the amount of people that were already waiting. So we waited and waited and waited. Well 30 min wait turned into an hour wait. 

We finally got a place to sit and waited for someone to acknowledge us. Finally we got to put in our drink orders! The drinks came in big mason jars and I ended up ordering sweet tea ($3), which was so incredibly sweet that I couldn't really drink it. 

My husband ordered KK which consisted of 3 piece chicken, 2 waffles, grits, and eggs with cheese and onions. I ordered Baby Ray which came with 3 piece chicken with gravy and 2 waffles. We also ordered side of collard greens.

We then waited and waited and waited for our food which took about 50 mins! The waitress never once came over to see how we were doing or even informed us about our food. The kitchen looked like there was no sense of order and it was chaotic behind the counter. 

So now on to the food. The chicken with gravy and the collards were the only things that were actually delicious. The waffles were soft and dense, it was more like a pancake shaped like waffles. The grits were cold and congealed, I'm assuming it would've been good if it was hot because the flavors were decent. 

Basically we waited an hour for the table, hour for the food, and ate in 15 minutes. I'm not sure if I would return to give it another try but if I did, I would go on a weekday.",2,"[u' sweet tea', u' incredibly sweet', u' actually delicious']",1.7,[u' not sure'],-0.25

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"In town visiting family (August 19, 2016) and they recommended this restaurant.  As usual, before I headed over I took a moment to read the Yelp reviews.  How in the world does this place get such good reviews?  

We were a party of three adults and a baby and were told the wait was going to be 15-25 minutes. A party of 12 came in after us and were seated before us. Our wait was the full 25 minutes.   The woman at the front desk asked for a name to call when it time to be seated.  I said ""Darian."" She repeated back Victoria. Umm no Darian, she laughed and said not even close huh.  She called out Dirk when it was time to be seated. If they turned the music down just a little bit (not too much because I loved whatever station they were playing) they could possibly hear their customers a little better.  The front desk person was wearing a t shirt that read ""Ghetto Fabulous"" on it.  Ghetto, for sure, fabulous was still something to be seen.

The food - Overrated and way too salty - so salty you can see the salt simply sitting on the Stupid fry.  My son loved the catfish sandwich and my daughter was sick from the tre-tre (two drumsticks and a waffle) less than 30 minutes after leaving the restaurant.  Serving the drinks in various sized mason jars was a creative touch - mixing all of the alcoholic drinks with Kool Aid is once again ghetto.  The drinks are super strong (maybe because they are mixed with Kool Aid?) I didn't have the waffle but just looking at it, I wasn't impressed.

The service -Lots of Lo Lo staff simply walking around aimlessly, chatting with the folks at the front door, walking in and out from the patio area, cackling it up with each other, not doing much of anything really.  I will say that our server is what made me give this review two whole stars.  She did a good job and you could tell (besides her telling us) that she was very busy.  She took our drink order and told us that she is also our bartender, so please bear with her but she will be back as soon as she can.  She brought the drinks and 20 minutes later came back with water and finally took our food order.  Same long wait followed by what appeared to be sincere apologies when we asked for more napkins and a take out box. She was very accommodating. Turns out she was also our cashier. Her name was Shamreya.   I ended up giving her the full tip that was ""suggested"" on the bottom of the receipt out of pity, quite honestly.

Parking - one word - SUCKED

Besides getting sick, my kids (young adults themselves) actually liked this place - maybe because it appeared as if it was managed by young adults.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"4.5 stars! 

To borrow a phrase from George Takei, oh my! We finally tried this place out after hearing about it from several of our friends and coworkers who have lived in the area for quite some time. We read a few reviews, liked what we saw, and made it a point to go. We were greeted as soon as we walked in and shown to our table. The decor is sort of a modern meets rustic look.  

Our waitress Leslie came right over and took our drink order.  The menu is huge, and we wanted to try everything on it. Needless to say it took us a few minutes to make our decisions, but then we were ready to bring on the hurt. We knew then that this was simultaneously going to be both the best and worst decision ever for dinner. My wife ordered the Lo Lo's chicken and waffles, I ordered the 8 double D's chicken breast and waffle, and we got an order of fries and corn bread to share. We also ordered two drinks off of their specialty menu, a Keep it Simple for my wife, and the tropical drink for me. Sadly, I can't remember the name of the drink. 

The fries and the corn bread came out first.  The corn bread was good, but not the best I've had. The fries are hand cut with a glorious seasoning.  Anyone who knows me well knows my unhealthy obsession with french fries...It's rivaled only by my love of tacos. The fries never stood a chance. Every now and then I would pause for half a second to dip one in ketchup, but they were so good they really didn't need it. Shortly thereafter the rest of the food came out.

The main course came out on large dishes that were roughly the size of trampolines. My inner fat kid was practically leaping up and down at this point. The amount of food piled on the plates bordered on unnatural. It was about this time that my wife and I realized we may have ordered too much food. We didn't care. We were too busy staring down our plates like two gunslingers before a high noon showdown and furiously snapping photos for our future Yelp post. Our stomachs grumbled with anticipation.

The chicken was delicious, juicy, and breaded and fried southern style. The waffles were soft and made to order with their special batter. I went all out, ripping my chicken breast off the bone and stuffed it in the waffle, loaded it with butter, syrup, and hot sauce. With a big grin on my face, I folded it up like a giant delicious taco and ate it like it was my last meal on earth. My inner fat kid was getting worried at this point, because he knew there was more to come. Syrup and butter streaming down my hands, I enjoyed it to the last crumb. The waffle split and threatened to spill its contents all over the table several times, but I'm no amateur taco eater. The hot sauce is medium, with a little bit of a kick but not too much, and a nice spicy offset to the sweetness of the syrup.  

Throughout the course of our meal, our table was visited several times by our waitress and other staff members. They kept the drinks filled and cleared away finished plates. Everyone was friendly and made for a great service experience.

To finish it off, we ordered the banana pudding for dessert. No true Southerner can pass up banana pudding when given the choice. I grew up on my grandma's banana pudding, so there was a high bar of expectations set. I was not disappointed. The style was different from that of my grandmothers, but it was still very good. They use crumbled vanilla wafers as both a base and a topping. As with the drinks, it comes out served in a large mason jar. Be warned, it's a big serving, so come hungry or be ready to share.  My wife threw in the towel about a quarter of the way through. Rookie.  I tore through it like a Serengeti Lion devouring its prey.

My hunger sated and my inner fat kid crying for mercy, I lay down my fork and napkin in victory. I'm fairly certain I ate the equivalent of two days caloric intake. with a smile on my face, I thought dreamily of the Tums sitting on my nightstand at home.",4,"[u' so good', u' special batter', u' hot sauce', u' delicious taco', u' hot sauce', u' nice spicy', u' great service', u' not disappointed', u' very good', u' fairly certain']",5.456428571,"[u' unhealthy obsession', u' little bit']",-0.5875
YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"I really like LoLo's.

They have very good food.  I can easily say that everything I've ever ordered at LoLo's has been delicious.

The sweet tea is as advertised.  When ordering the Kool Aid, I usually order it as half water, half Kool Aid as to not slip into a diabetic coma.

The prices are on par as far as soul food places go.

I do not mind waiting for good food, so I won't score negatively on that.

The wait staff is pretty attentive as far as the usual wait service goes.

I only have one complaint.  There have been a couple of times when there were a couple of unruly, obnoxiously loud (maybe even ungodly loud) people there while I was dining with my wife and 2 daughters.  They were using expletives and using language that had graphic sexual undertones.  Mind you, this was at a volume that was loud enough for everyone in the restaurant to hear.  The wait staff and management didn't even bother to ask them to simmer down and have some respect for the other patrons.  

I've always had really good dining experiences at LoLo's.  The staff is friendly, other than a couple of incidents, the other patrons are lively and provide a good dining atmosphere.  Other than the two times I mentioned, I thought this was a really good family restaurant.

I really do wish when incidents like this occur, that the wait staff or management steps up and ensures that a couple of people don't ruin the dining experience of everyone in the restaurant.  I am no stranger to eating in a loud restaurant where the level of noise is very high due to everyone having normal conversations.  The two times that I was unfortunate enough to go through this has actually kept me from going back.

There's no doubt I'll go there again.  I will crave their fried chicken and catfish enough to cross my fingers and give it another try.

 Okay so I want to start saying that the food is great, it really is but that's where it stops. 
The wait you're almost guaranteed to face is atrocious and the servers don't give you accurate times. The first time I visited I told them I had a flight in two hours and they assured me it was fine. That time we spent 1 and and half hours waiting before we had to leave without eating. 
We gave LoLo's a second chance whilst passing through Phoenix and once again the same inaccurate waiting times were being told to everyone.
When we were seated and ordered the first waitress we dealt with was lovely, a bit smile and very helpful, however another waitress who did stop by ant one point was so rude and uncaring it put me off coming here again. No greetings, no smile, she looked like she HATED her job and we could feel it.
The food was great though, lightly season chicken that was tender and juicy without any grease. A simple light waffle to accompany it with a nice little pot of syrup. I order over-medium eggs on the side that came out undercooked and when I returned them they came back completed solid and overcooked which was a shame.
The meals didn't leave us full at all. I had 2 eggs, 1 waffle and 3 chicken pieces and my partner had 2 wings and a waffle. We both wanted to eat more but considering our bill was already at $25 with no drinks we decided against it.

The place is pretty small, but they are big on food. The first time i went, our portions were huge - good enough for two leftover meals. I learned on my second visit to not over do myself.

The chicken is well cooked - the meat is still juicy and moist on the inside, while the outside batter is fried to crispy perfection.

The side of mac and cheese was the best I've had in a while - it seemed to have sauteed onions with multiple types of cheese as the base.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Do not bother and here is why.  I have worked in restaurants back in the day in the south and have won a few contests for recipes so i feel relatively qualified to give a review about this.

Here's what was good:  the service was good and wait staff friendly.  Portions were large.

Here's what was wrong:

1.  Chicken breast was over cooked (dry) and way under-seasoned. This being their main product, it should have been really good.  Big disappointment.

2.  Waffle was not at all crispy nor very warm (chicken was plenty hot though).

3.  Fried green tomatoes were tasty but the tomatoes were half ripe (pink).  You do not make fried green tomatoes with semi-ripe tomatoes.  They taste different and the texture of the tomato comes out mushy if not green.  

4.  Tea is a Southern soul food staple, however Phoenix water is crappy and the water there is not filtered.  You can definitely tell this in the tea. 

5.  Sort of expensive considering.

We also had cornbread and it was okay.  Nothing to write home about.

What i am saying here is this is an approximation of Southern soul food but it ain't the real deal.  It came off like a trendy chain restaurant getting by on average ingredients.

The first piece of chicken, a chicken thigh, was SUPER good. Moist, tender, juicy, everything you would want in a piece of fried chicken. However, the second piece, chicken breast, was rather dry. I guess it makes sense since chicken breast is typically hard to cook juicy. Waffles were good. Didn't really care for the biscuit and plain grits. But the shrimp and grits were really good.

It's hard to find a place where they put the right seasonings in the fried chicken, but Lo-Lo's got it just right.   A great balance of seasoning to give the chicken some zing and super crispy.  The catfish was great, with a similar seasoning.  Nice big filets and not greasy at all, same goes for the redfish.  The redfish was like a southern version of fish and chips.  I'm not a fan of gizzards, but Lo-Lo's got it right so that they were tender instead of rubbery and how can it fail smothered with gravy?

I've read the many reviews warning me about Lo-Lo's 40+ minute wait... but seeing no one standing in the way of the misting fan, we decided to trudge on in... and we were SO lucky to find more empty tables than filled. We sat down in the nice cool mustered colored room, lined with Framed pictures depitcing the Jazz Era... 

We were quickly brought menus and we ordered a round of tea... I had the Half sweet & Half unsweetened tea... my cousin chose the sweetened tea and my mom the chose the unsweetened tea. When the HUGE mason jars hit the table they were excited! I held my own taste test and concluded that Yelpers are always right and that the half & half rules. 

Our waitress was nice enough to explain some of the dishes to us. We ordered and waited a lil while... not as long as I did the first time I went. While we waited and talked the rest of the tables around us quickly filled and we considered ourself fortunate to have arrived when we did. I told them of the warnings about going to Lo-Lo's after church on Sunday... Expect an hour long wait! They whistled and said that it couldn't be that good... 

and then the food arrived...

It was better than I remember it! i chose the Soul-food platter which comes with 3 pieces of fried chicken and your choice of two sides... I chose a waffle and smothered potatos and a large muffin type hunk of cornbread. My mom ordered the same thing but chose potato salad & yams as her sides. My cousin got a pair of drumsticks with a waffle. 

We were all silent for a good five minutes. When we finally went up for air. My mom couldn't believe how good her yams were. She looked like she wanted to cry! lol... and she said the potato salad was great and that the chicken was EXACTLY what she wanted!!  My cousin was inlove with the chrunchy-type crispness salty sweetness of the chicken & Waffle combination. and I, I was about to DRINK my smothered potatos, which are nothing but simply boiled potatos swimming in this basil-thyme(?) flavored chicken gravy that was sent here from heaven!! IT was the BEST gravy I EVER EVER tasted!! I was happily taking a bite of chicken with a bite of waffle and then followed it with a nice perfect smothered chunk of potato... when... when... it was GONE!! ARGGHHH!! When are they going to invent never empty bowls?!?! huh?! WHEN?!

There was nothing but small micro bits of potato swimming in the most amazing grazy... and all I had was a fork... but there... was still some left... and not a spoon in sight, but I could pick up the lil mini bowl.... 

""DON'T EVEN think about it!"" My mom scolded me while reading my thoughts

DANG! 

I reached a happy medium when I got smart and skewerd a nice piece of chicken and dunked it in the gravy and I was SO back in business!! :D whoo hoo!! It was heaven. pure heaven. 

I know very few things about heaven... I know O'odham Cumbia in Heaven... and I know Lo-Lo's gravy is poured from FOUNTAINS in heaven!! haha.... 

Meanwhile - back on Earth, we devoured our food. I honestly thought I was going to have tons leftover for my lunch the next day... my mom thought the same... no such luck for any of us! My mom was in extacy over her yams that she asked for their recipe... the waitress said she'd ask and quickly came back with: brown sugar, cinnamon & vanilla - boiled and NOT baked... and that's it. And PLEASE let me tell ya'll - she has NEVER ever done that with me before... this woman doesn't like ANYTHING/BODY... and that day, she fell in love with those yams! (Where's my calender?!)

We were laughing and talking about how good the lemonade is (oh yeah - when I needed a refil, I just asked for some lemonade instead of more tea, she did it no problem... she also did the same for my cousin who tried the red kool-aid) and how great the food was when I got a call from a good friend of mine. I told him where I was when he made fun of me and told me to clog my artaries... I made a face and asked him in a rather rude tone if he's ever been to Lo-Lo's, he said no. And then I told him... he'll never get how little I care about my artieries when I'm here until he tries it for himself! Only until you try it do you get how amazing it is...

After waiting about 15 mins and 5 customers later i asked the hostess when someone would be able to take my order as I was on lunch, she told me that she had to find someone to take my order. I waited another 10 mins, So now I was 45min into my 1 hour lunch and not even an order placed. Needless to say. I left hungry and upset(don't play with my food). They didn't even notice. I called and place a complaint with the manager Mills. I explained everything to him and he gave me his personal cell phone number and told me to call him and he would make sure I was taken care of and that my next order would be on the house. About 2-3 week later I called and tried to place an order. When I spoke to Mills he made several bad management decision 1. He didn't handle my order personally he told me to call the main number and place an order. When I called the told me that they are only taking payment over the phone for call in orders, I explained to them that Mills told me to call and he would be taking care of my order, they said they had to verify this. 2.Mills then got on the phone and began to question me like I had made the whole thing up.  Stating did He tell me that he would take care of my order? Or are those my words? I explained the initial situation and 3. he said he remembers me but doesn't remember stating  the order would be on the house. He seemed hesitant and said well what would you like to order?

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"The first place in two weeks where I've felt welcome in Phoenix! 

My boyfriend finally came to visit, and after my two trying weeks of lectures and starting student-teaching, I wanted a treat, even though I had just caught a cold from one of my students. We had been back-and-forth yelping, and Lo-Lo's was something we knew we definitely had to try.... but we had no idea how to get there from ASU in Tempe. After trying for half an hour to use the Valley Metro Trip Planner (which gets a NEGATIVE 4 stars for being completely unintuitive and impossible!), we called Lo-Lo's and were immediately giving light rail and bus directions. 

After probably an hour and a half, during which we are getting hungrier and hungrier, and all our conversation is redirecting to fried chicken, we walk in the door and are immediately welcomed and told to sit whereever we like. We grab a table, and are offered drinks. I got a re-fillable jar of some of the best sweet tea I've ever had (although walking three blocks in 100 degree weather may have biased that opinion sometime), and we also got two ice waters to rehydrate. We looked at the menu and immediately knew what we wanted. I ordered the soul food platter, 3 pieces of fried chicken, cornbread, and sides of mac n'cheese and collard greens. Daniel ordered the Lil' Amadi, which was 1 leg and 1 thigh with a waffle, and a side of red beans (no rice). 

Okay. So. I don't like waffles. I'm used the Belgian waffles, which are way too huge and fill me up with bread taste and make me feel bloated. Lo-Lo's waffle blew me away; it literally was like buttery, slightly mealy, air. I kept stealing bites until I basically ate the whole thing, drenched in maple syrup and fluffy whipped butter. The red beans and collard greens were incredible! We both agreed that they were our favorites of the whole meal (two former vegans... haha): the beans had a touch of sweetness, simultaneously savory and tender. The collards had basically no bitterness at all, but weren't super salty. They were tender and cut into small slices that perfectly combined into a side-appropritate mouthfull. The mac n'cheese was pretty good but I didn't really focus on its taste. The chicken! Oh my god. I've never had breast meat that was still juicy. Incredible texture, the tenderness of the meat and the crispness of the skin juxtaposed. This place definitely blows Roscoe's out, and as a native LA-er, I'm sorry to say it. 

The price is really great, less than 30 altogether, and we left a large tip because the service was so great! We felt so welcomed by the staff, and we could tell that they were having a chill time as well, singing along to Justin Timberlake in the next room. The only downside (not on their end) was that because of my slight cold, I couldn't taste all the flavors as well as I could have otherwise; that's the only reason this isn't getting a 5, and I can see myself changing that... I also cursed myself for forgetting my camera.

We came about 3pm on a Sunday and had a 10-15 min wait. I loved looking around the restaurant and really liked the red brick inside and out. Also I liked the decor of lights made out of mason jars and TVs around. Waiting was not a problem. Once we were sat we were greeted with a friendly waiter, I think his name was Joseph. 

I ordered the catfish and waffle and my wife had the #2 Baby Ray, basically 3 piece chicken meal with 2 waffles with gravy and onions. We also had a side of the Mac n cheese too. All in all I thought the food was outstanding!  Probably best friend chicken I've ever had. I loved it even more with a bite of chicken and waffle at the same time! Simply amazing. The catfish was also equally amazing. Very flakey and fried just right. The waffles were made perfect too and I can't forget about the gravy. Very thick and yummy. Oh and the Mac! I heard that they have mushrooms in the Mac. I'm not a fan if mushrooms but gave it a try and I'm glad I did. Was also great
We ended our meal with a taste of the red velvet cake.  But we had to get it to go because we were both so stuffed! But when I did try it, it's didn't disappoint!  Very hearty and I liked the walnuts in it.

I got over my original white-girl fear and smeared plenty of hot sauce on my chicken then dipped that goodness into the syrup and wrapped it all in a bit of waffle. Oh yeah, it hit the spot!

So as soon as I picked up my rental car I drove straight here! It was a friday morning, but after normal breakfast time, so it wasn't that packed.  However, they only offered valet.  Which was very annoying.  It was complimentary but totally unnecessary.  

Once inside, we were seated immediately, their menu has a lot of options, which did get my gf, but for me there was no reason not go with one of the chicken and waffle combos.  

Their sweet tea is SUPER Sweet, so if you're not used to the south and sweet tea, be prepared to be overwhelmed.  My gf got the red velvet pancakes based on the picture, I tried to persuade her to get a chicken and waffle combo, instead.  Well she got it, and didn't eat past the 2nd bite.  They were pretty bad.

I got one of the biggest chicken and waffle combos, that came with eggs, grits, and I think 4 pieces of chicken?

So there was plenty to share.  The chicken itself, was just OK, the Breakfast Klub in Houston is much better.  The waffles however, were pretty damn good.  It tasted like there was orange flavor mixed into the batter?

Fresh clean new much more spacious....So you ask why did I take away a star? The place is trying too hard. They intentionally spell stuff wrong on the menu in fake slang to give it a hood feeling. Its more expensive than it used be. They've added new combinations of chicken just to make the menu longer. The waffles now are more doughy no flavor. I got the smothered chicken with a gravy that was neither southern tasty or appealing to the eye. The bill for two people with one alcholic drink one appetizer and two dishes was ~50. I'd rather drive further to the closest popeyes and be under 10 bucks a person.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"*yay!* this is my 200th review!!!!

Ok, so I wanted to do something special for my 200th review, so I took myself to LoLo's chicken and waffles for lunch today.  I had really high expectations, but left kind of feeling a little let down.  

I got there, and sitting outside the front door was some girl who I guess was the hostess.  She asked me how many and I told her it was just me. I felt kind of awkward.  She showed me inside and asked if I wanted to sit at this crammed little bar facing basically a freaking wall.  I asked to be seated somewhere else, as it was really uncomfortable to sit there.  

So, she sat me in another room near the kitchen area.  Did this place used to be a house or something?  It had to have been.  It feels like theres a zillon different little rooms with tables.  

Anyways, so I finally got sat at a real table.  Mazel Tov.   A girl took my drink order, but the service was slow to order. I waited and waited and finally a server came and took my order. I went for the 2 chicken legs and a waffle.  Service actually kinda sucked, but I'm willing to let it go.  I won't hold it against them since everyone seems to like it so much.

So, they bring out my food.  I guess it was okay, but not the greatest food Ive sunk my teeth into. I surprisingly was full when I finished.  the chicken was good, but I think the waffles is what got me.  It came with a nice amount of butter, which I smeared all over the waffle, and then drowned it in syrup. I liked it!  Thier butter really made a difference.

While I was eating, I was happy to see 2 autographs of the Harlem Globetrotters players on the wall, both of which I obviously know.  Impressive!

Needless to say, I guess I was expecting more.  Service was spotty, unimpressive, and actually kind of sucked.  Food was decent, but not earth shattering.

It was great for them to let us know off the bat but sad to think of all that could have been with that chicken.  We tried a couple drinks and had the two two (two waffles and two chicken wings) and the D man (waffle and fried catfish).  Everything was superb.

They had served me the sides that come with the order and by the time they were almost gone I finally got my main course. It was the catfish served plain on a plate! There was no seasoning, the batter was tasteless, and I must say the food overall was pretty damn weak! 

The drinks we ordered were Kool-Aid thinking how cool would it be to get something that harkens back to childhood. Strangely this stuff burned my tongue because it wasn't mixed right. So I asked for a Bloody mary. The bloody mary came to me in what looked like an 8oz serving for a whopping $8.50!!!! This is ridiculous, its pre made mix with a piece of bacon in it!

Apparently, we had met up with Erica O for lunch at Lo Lo's. We drank sweet tea out of Mason jars. The menu had items named after characters from Spike Lee films. There was a ""Toy Toy"" and a ""Betty Boop"" in 'Crooklyn' right? I could swear there was a Sha Nay Nay in there somewhere.

I was told I had ordered fried chicken smothered in mashed potatoes and gravy. Yes. Smothered. As in ""served as one entity"". According to Misty S, I tried fruitlessly to eat the aforementioned mad creation with a fork and knife, to try and give our lunch companion Erica O the impression that I was not, in fact, a gluttonous fatty without dignity, as my mashed potato-flavored chicken was trying to suggest.

I had mentioned, before passing out in the car, that I found the waffles to be fluffy bundles of cinnamon joy. And that they tasted just fine without syrup, which was good, because I ended up getting most of my syrup on the damned fried chicki-mashed potatoes.

They had offered us dessert afterwards, which doesn't make any sense to me. If I had just eaten two syrup-less waffles and fried chicken soaked in mashed potatoes and covered in mis-aimed maple syrup, the last thing I'd expect is to be offered red velvet cake. But I'm sure at the time the idea seemed much more reasonable.

The food couldn't have been that bad, for though it gave me a ""food coma"" as the natives call it, I didn't suffer any intestinal woes.

The story sounded so fantastic and sensational I almost didn't believe. Surely I would've remembered dining in such a wonderland of soul food stereotypes.

Now that's my kind of breakfast.
 
Lolo's Chicken and Waffles is a small joint located in a not so lovely residential area of Phoenix . Don't let the surrounding area fool you though, inside this small Soul food joint you will find some delicious eats. The inside of Lolo's has a very homey look and feel. Their menu is full of different Soul food fare. The coolest thing about Lolo's is that their entire menu is offered all day. If you want breakfast for dinner, you can. If you want dinner for breakfast, go for it. It's awesome!
 
My fiancé and I both ordered their KK's breakfast, which consisted of three pieces of fried chicken, two waffles (we both added pecans to our waffles), cheese grits and scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and onions. We also got a side of Mac and cheese, Yams, sausage patties and a slice of red velvet cake. My father ordered their fired chicken omelet, which was made with fried chicken, bell peppers, onions and cheese. Everything that we ate that morning was excellent. The fried chicken was really juicy and flavorful, especially the dark meat. The waffles were light and fluffy and packed full of pecans. The yams were really sweet and had a nice cinnamony flavor. Their sausage patties, which they make in house, were some of the best I have ever had. The Mac and cheese was really cheesy and gooey. The grits were also really cheesy and also really buttery. My dad's omelet was delicious. They made his omelet with four eggs and loaded it with juicy fried chicken (skin and all) and lots of grilled veggies. They also topped it with a ton of shredded cheese. The red velvet cake, which we took to go, was really moist. The cream cheese frosting, which was covered with pecans, was not overly sweet and was really creamy. To wash down all this yummy grub I had a huge glass of super sweet cherry Kool-Aid. My fiancé and dad both had their sweet tea, which was just as sweet as their Kool-Aid.
 
The service here was great. Our waitress was really funny and friendly. She was shocked to see us order so much food, especially at 10am. She joked around with us the whole time and always kept my mason jar of Kool-Aid filled to the brim. The prices here were great too.

We decided to stop in for lunch on our day off. we were told our wait would be 10-15 min not even sitting down 5 min we were told our table was ready. We walk to the back (chick'n coop) only to be told our table was not ready. So I sat down in the chair just outside the chick'n coop door only be to be told by the rude hostess (a Hispanic lady) that I could not sit and wait there I needed to go sit down in the front. As go sit in the front as I was told not even 50 seconds later I'm told you're tables ready. My husband had gone to the bathroom and I told the rude hostess I would wait for my husband to walk out of the bathroom before being seated so we could sit down in the chick'n coop together. The look she gave me said I was not supposed to do that. But I did anyways. We were seated and our waiter Steve I believe was his name came and got our drink order & after awhile our food order. I ordered the catfish my husband ordered the chicken & waffles. I asked for lemons for my catfish Steve never brought them to me I had to ask a table busser to bring me some. Steve came & refilled my husbands drink I still had some in my cup but by the time I was done Steve never came back another random gentlemen I think he was also a busser because I had seen him sweeping & cleaning off a table earlier. Offered to get me a refill, we revived our check & to go cups and left. The service was not very helpful or friendly in my eyes. The food was amazing I would only choose to go back for  he food.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Not impressed... For various reasons. 

Upon arrival, I was told 20-30 minute wait time for a party of 2 and I was seated after a 50 minute wait.

I was then seated in a small room in the back, which has high echoes, alongside two families of 4 and a party of 10, full of children. (Not that I don't like children.. But in a small cramped room..) Needless to say, it was extremely loud and almost uncomfortable. 

Our order was taken not long after being seated, but it took almost an HOUR to get my food. We both ordered chicken tenders and waffles with a side of cornbread and a biscuit. For being ""known"" for those dishes, I don't think it warranted such a long preparation time. 

I'm from the east coast and have had my fair share of chicken and waffles alongside the coast and the south.. Can't say this one ranks in my top three. Good for Phoenix, sure. But not with that ridiculous wait time. 

I also expected it to be burning hot since it was a long wait, but it was warm at best. 

On the plus -- the biscuit was excellent and very big. The lemonade/tea was also refreshing. Corn bread was good, but a little dry.

With that said, our experience here was terrible.  Here's how it went down: we arrive, put our name in and wait a very reasonable 10 minutes to be seated.  Once seated, we went through the menu and chose what to order.  10 minutes goes by.  Then 15 minutes - not a single staff member appeared.  We were being totally ignored.  I started checking Yelp for nearby restaurants and planning our escape from what looked to be an impending ""major fail.""  Then suddenly our waiter appeared and was apologetic.  We were nice in return.  He blamed his slowness on a nearby table that was ""being difficult"" (tacky) and took our drink orders.  Another 10 minutes goes by.  Then 15.  Finally he shows up with our drinks and says nothing - just throws them down.  Weird.  He was having a bad night and we were paying the price.  Before he has another chance to run off, I politely tell him we'd like to get our order in.  He takes our order and runs off again saying very little.  25 minutes pass before he brings out the appetizer.  Then another 20 minutes later our entrees appear.  The whole time he's being as scarce as he possibly can and saying as little as possible every time he appears. Finally whilst eating our food another member of the staff (Susan) drops by and is quite helpful.  She refills our drinks and takes the long-devoured appetizer plate away.  She stops by several times to ask if we need anything.  Good job, Susan!  Unfortunately she turns our table back over to our original waiter who (after another unreasonably long wait) ended up bringing out the check.  He had nothing else to say.  Pretty astounding service for a restaurant that charges $20+/plate (and - based on the mandatory Valet parking - would like to charge more).  As we looked at the final bill at the end of the (long) night, everyone felt cheated by the stunning lack of service.  I'm too nice to stiff someone on the tip, but I came darn close here.

We will not be back.

I arrived at 6 on a Tuesday night and it was very busy. Got my table and scanned the huge menu. Settled on the server's recommendation: the Soulfood Platter. It came with several options so I chose three pieces of fried chicken, cornbread and two sides (I chose Mac N Cheese plus Collard Greens)  I added an iced tea for a total of $20.04 plus tip. 

My dinner arrived in about 8-10 mins. The pressure-cooked chicken was hot, crispy, juicy, seasoned well and cooked perfectly. The cornbread was okay. The corn kernels added a nice touch but honey would've made it better. The Mac was okay. It needed toasted bread crumbs for finish. Nice and creamy tho. Never had collard greens before-they were excellent. Kinda like if spinach and cabbage had a baby. They add bacon and red pepper flakes here (not much tho), so it had a good smoky flavor.

The first occasion I ordered to go, I ordered ahead of time to make sure that it would be ready they said it would be ready around 12:20pm i got there at 12:10pm the food was already bagged up and sitting there cold the waffle cold and like rubber they might I add they forgot my cornbread and my waffle I had to go out to my car and look in the bag to notice they weren't in the bag after paying my $17.00 for it. I got to work I was on my lunch break and called to reach out to their manager who asks me to come back but I told him I only had a 30 min lunch and couldnt return until after 6pm and he said thats fine but wanted the food. I couldnt come by after work as I had to pick up my kids from daycare on the other side of town then he ignore my attempts to reach out to him until today 12/6/2015 I called him and he said he would not replace my food as they get calls like mine all the time and that he'd do something nice for us but not replace the food I said thats fine I'm coming in with my wife Ill see you in a minute. We get there are seated at 5:35pm we explain that I'd like to see the manager the waitress then says ok I will get him, she asks us what we want to drink we order a water and a sweet tea and we wait 15 mins for our drinks ready to order we see her help everyone else and even brings us napkins after 15 mins! and doesnt ask us for our order or even bring us our drinks! We had to ask a nice young man by the name of Jacquan who immediately helped us pt in our order, then the waitress suddenly shows up with our drinks and seems upset she says I talked to the manager and he just said he'd give you a dessert, so instead of confronting and greeting his guest he hides behind his staff and doesn't even come out and speak to us.

Most of the choices on the menu are reasonably priced, and the new design of the place is open and bright. I also thought it was very clean inside, which one would not expect from a restaurant that prides itself on serving neon colored and super sweet cool-aide. 

While the waffles are nothing to write home about, the chicken is fried to perfection. It was tough finding a parking spot, and we had to eventually park across the street. Not knowing if you car is going to get towed kinda made me rush through my meal. The grits left something to be desired - they were dry and had little seasoning. If it wasn't for the huge hunk of butter (which seems to be the only ingredient/condiment that the kitchen used), I would have not eaten the grits at all. Thankfully, the hot sauce made them taste alright.

The decor and theme inside is catchy and looks like what you would expect a great chicken and waffle joint to look like. The mason jar glasses and chicken theme along with the specialty Kool-Aide flavors is neat. Everything was neat and clean inside and the staff was friendly and pleasant. 

Long Wait and Slow Service

The wait on Sunday was 45 minutes for a table for two which is not that uncommon for a great food place on the weekend. However, it's still a 45 minute wait once we were seated we then figured out why the wait was so long. It was not the busy number of customers its the EXTREMELY slow service.

We placed an appetizer order and that took about 35 minutes for the catfish beignets. When they did arrive they were tasty and we enjoyed them. We placed our order not long after the app order and that took about another 45 minutes after the app. So all in all about an hour for our food to be delivered. We noticed many of the other tables were taking 45 min to an hour as well for their food. 

When a kitchen is making food fresh I know it can take longer to get out to the customer and is well worth it usually. However, an hour to serve chicken and waffles even fresh is excessive. If the kitchen could expedite faster they could reduce the wait times and turn the tables more quickly improving the customer experience. 

Food

We both ordered chicken and waffle dishes I added on scrambled eggs and my wife selected grits. The chicken was tasty and juicy with a nice crispy skin. The waffle was regular waffles you would get in a hotel thin, bland, and not crispy. The eggs I ordered they messed up the order and needed to replace them. I was impressed how quickly they took care of it and remade the eggs. The grits were cooked perfect and my wife enjoyed them with the cheese and butter. 

Overall I can see the draw people have with the location. The owner has done a great job of branding the business, creating excitement inside with the decor, and his staff is friendly. The only downside is the long wait to get inside, long wait for the food, and mixed up order. The actual chicken and waffles were good and very similar to other places I have visited around the country. 

They are worth visiting and it is a good experience. If you visit on a non-weekend it might less of a wait as well.

Just know ahead of time that Lo-Lo's is definitely going to put you to sleep- literally and figuratively!

I had to do it the right way and get the obligatory Chicken & Waffles- ""Tre-tre"" which is two drumsticks and a waffle ... and a sweet tea to drink. Amazingly fried chicken with hot sauce is pure gluttonous heaven, followed with the sweet and crisp waffle. The sweet tea is so, so good it's refreshing and sweet! Also you get it in a large mouth mason jar that is enough for two people!

Service is a bit slow, but reasonable for the amount of people dining in and parking may be a bit problematic. Once you step out of your car the smell of waffles wafting in the air will resolve some of that stress- trust.

I'm going to say what I tell everyone about having chicken & waffles ... it is one glorious meal, then you feel like garbage afterwards- but it's totally worth it! Speaking of which, chicken and waffles sound really good about now.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"I've been waiting forever to try chicken and waffles and I'm so glad Lo-Lo's was the spot to pop my chicken and waffles cherry. 

It's a humble restaurant in the middle of nowhere, which, had it not been for the huge text sprawled on the side of a building, we would have never noticed the tiny entrance. 

I came here with my girlfriend while visiting her at institute and this was one of the highest reviewed restaurants in the area so we thought it would be a good idea to give it a try. 

The staff is extremely welcoming and helpful. They took the time to help us find a way to the restaurant using public transportation(we were coming from ASU so we had to use both the light rail and bus system) when the trip planner had failed us miserably and would otherwise have left us stranded in 100 degree weather. 

The space is very cozy and the table and chairs are very much something laypeople could own(wood - painted, none of that hyper-modern furniture here). It's not a super big restaurant so I imagine they could get packed very easily during peak business hours. 

The food here is absolutely amazing. I got to try a few dishes:

1. Lil' Amadi(waffle plus leg and thigh of chicken) - This is the best fried chicken I've ever had. The skin was not soggy at all and had a very nice crisp/crunch to eat. The skin was not rubbery at all and gave away easily with a little resistance(which is nice, because super flaky skin is never good and a teeny bit of resistance keeps the skin together on the chicken). The skin to meat ratio was also good - in other words, I didn't feel like I was either eating nothing but skin or that they were being skimpy with the skin. The meat was extremely juicy and my girlfriend let me try some of her white meat and it is one of the few times(other than in Pho) that I've had white meat that is juicy. The waffle was also one of the best waffles I've ever had and I usually hate waffles. The waffle here was on the thinner side and had great texture. It was slightly crispy on the outside while maintaining a very moist inside - great texture combination. Also, the waffle wasn't soggy. This is key because I usually hate Belgian waffles because they're too thick, cakey, and tend to get soggy in the middle and are just plain gross. They give you a healthy dose of butter and syrup which made eating the chicken and waffles much more enjoyable.

Soul Food Platter - My girlfriend and I basically ordered two dishes and tried eachother's dishes. The soul food platter allows you to choose between chicken or fish and a choice of two side dishes and corn bread. My girlfriend got chicken(three-ish pieces - sometimes I don't consider the chicken wing a full piece because of the higher bone to meat ratio than other parts of the chicken), collard greens, and mac-n-cheese. The collard greens were delicious! They weren't too salty like some of the other times I've tried them. They were also cooked just right - not too soft due to overcooking but not too hard due to undercooking. The leaves were soft and the stalk gave more solid texture to juxtapose with the leaves(but not saying that the stalk was hard - it wasn't - just more firm than the leaves). The mac-n-cheese was okay. I've definitely had better. To me, it was a slightly more gourmet version of the Kraft's mac-n-cheese. The corn bread was also just okay. It was on the more dry side and I ended up having to dip the corn bread in sauce because my salivary glands were running low on lubricant. 

Red Beans - These were delicious! My girlfriend thinks they cooked them with ham to give it a slightly smokey, salty taste and I think I agree. They're not too sweet which I definitely find to be a characteristic of cheap red beans. Lo-Lo's makes an effort to actually make their red beans savory and it's very evident. The sauce goes great with the cornbread as extra lubricant. 

In regards to side dishes I recommend getting the collard greens and red beans. 

Sweet Tea - My girlfriend says that iced tea is usually lackluster because it's just like drinking tea - except cold and that the defining factor to sweet tea is that it's sweet and refreshing - something cold drinks should be. I agree. The sweet tea here was divine and a perfect beverage to our meal and great to have when the weather outside was 100 degrees. Another big plus is that there were unlimited refills! It's served in a huge jar and we easily went through two of them. Amazing. 

One regret I have is not trying the red velvet cake. 

The food here is decently priced. It came out to roughly $27 for the both of us and we left extremely full and happy. 

The reason why I hesitate giving Lo-Lo's five stars is because I'm not a veteran chicken and waffles eater, but rather, a recently deflowered chicken and waffles novice. Until I've had more chicken and waffles to compare to, I will hold off the five stars and just give four stars for now.

No sooner did we get seated that we were told they were busy (I could tell) and we should either hurry up and get our order in, or wait for the next waitperson, since our waitress was leaving for the day (in the middle of lunch rush hours).

I immediately liked the high ceiling and covered patio with some cushioned seating.  They really want you to settle in while enjoying your meal.

The food was not incredible.  I might have a different review if I liked chicken and waffles, but I don't so I opted for the salmon croquette.  On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being fabulous, I'll give the salmon croquette a 3.  Sorry, but all I tasted was egg.  There was hardly any salmon and I won't be ordering that again.  Ever.
  
For veggies, the greens were delicious.  We ordered seconds.  They were not overcooked and had no meat flavoring. A+ The sweet potatoes were wonderful too.

My top sides are;

Buttered Corn outstanding 5 stars
Greens best I have had outside the house solid 5 stars
Mac and Cheese between a 4 and 5 just because some days it's on point and others it's just aight. 
Smothered potatoes 4 stars
Candied yams 4 stars
Rice and gravy 2 stars the gravy was disappointing had bell pepper in it.
My least favorite Red beans and rice 1 star, I love red beans and rice but not with BBQ sauce yuck. 

I had a little problem with the desert. I love Red velvet cake but theirs is disappointing. I went on Saturday and saw that delicious mountain of a cake in the window and knew I had to have a slice. I got it home it tasted like cornbread?! WTF Someone messed up and made it wrong. I called they offered me another the next day but that one wasn't much better. The sock it to me cake was very sweet. 

My standing order will be Chicken, mac n cheese and greens from now on! I have yet to try a waffle since I have been getting to go orders I don't know how well a waffle will travel. I like the initial crispness to my waffles. I will be back to dine in one day and I will get a waffle.

We came in and were told the wait would be 20 minutes, so that's fine, we stood close to the host stand because there was no seating in the waiting area open. Once people got up from there the manager at the front rudely told us to pretty much move because we were in the way. We ignored the attitude and were seated shortly anyways. Our server took our drink orders and food orders so all good there.. Fast forward an hour and a half later, we still had not received our food. Keep in mind the place was semi full. So we finally said something to a man who appeared to be a manager and he offered to go check on our food. He came back 5 minutes later with our food. Now I've been a server so I could tell this food had been sitting at the window for a good while and I believe the manager said something to the server about it. Unfortunately at this point we had no time to eat the food since 2 friends I was with had to leave for their flight already so we asked for boxes and the check (both were promptly given of course).

The place filled up pretty quickly after we arrived, so I would recommend calling ahead if you have a larger party (and they only seat your party once everyone has arrived, so keep that in mind, too).

Our waitress was Leslie and she was wonderful from the very start.  Friendly and accommodating she allowed us a bit of time to look over the menu and made recommendations based on our preferences, which worked out nicely.  I had the Lo-Lo's meal and he had the Double D meal, we shared an order of cornbread, cause...who turns down southern style cornbread?? We opted to try out a couple of their drinks which I cannot remember the names of, but they were good! 

The meals came out quickly an were exactly the way we ordered them and they smelled amazing. Chicken was cooked nicely and the breading was really well seasoned. Waffles were fluffy and perfect. The cornbread was gone within seconds of hitting the table. 

Despite being way too full for it, we shared a banana pudding for a dessert, which was worth every agonizingly over full bite! I highly recommend this if you from the south and like a good banana pudding with real slices of banana and wafer topping!

We thought it should be a light business that time of the week but soon discovered our mistake. This location seems to always be busy. By the time we were seated, received our food, paid our tab, and left it was 6:45 and the place was nearly empty.
In fairness there were nine in our party and a group like that doesn't just fit anywhere but it's still disheartening to watch people arrive an hour after you and get seated immediately. 
Food from the kitchen also was slow to arrive but, {and here is where the good news starts} it was very good!
We started with three appetizers, spicy corn fritters, fried green tomatoes, and fried green beans. I felt the beans were kind of bland but the corn fritters were tasty with the right amount of heat and the tomatoes were excellent.
I had decided on a beet and after ordering 3 different kinds with all being unavailable I settled for a glass of ice water. My co-diners raved about the sweet tea and kool aid drinks.
Most of my party ordered a variable of the signature chicken and waffles which we all enjoyed. My chicken tenders and waffle were very good. I like the breading and size of the tenders and the waffle was very tasty with a mound of soft sweet butter and a good syrup.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"This review breaks my heart. 

A few friends and I met up at the down town location, I was excited to see that the newly renovated and expanded LoLo's was now open for business! It is absolutely BEAUTIFUL!! 
That's about where the love ends with this review sadly. 

We were waiting for one other friend to arrive, they would not seat us until he was there, I have never had this issue at Lolo's. But wait we did. 

When we were finally seated the waitress took our food and drink order. 10 minutes goes by, no drinks. She comes to our table and says they are our of glasses and we have to wait for clean ones. We asked her if she could just put them in to-go cups, we didn't need the mason jars, she says sure. 10 more minutes go by. Finally out come our drinks, in mason jars. OI. 

Next up is the wait for the food. We literally waited an HOUR AND A HALF for our food to come to the table, and I believe the only reason why we got it then was because we had complained to the manager. The table that was seated 10 minutes after us, got fed up and left at about the hour 15 mark and walked out. A table next to us who had received their bill sat and waited a solid 20 minutes just to pay the dang thing! Our waitress completely ignored our table and section the whole time we waited. There were not even drink refills in that 1.5 hour wait. NOTHING. I got up and found a waitress and pointed out our table at the hour mark and asked how long the food wait was, she said 40 minutes, when I told her we were already well passed that she said she would find out what was going on. Nothing. Then our waitress walks by our section at the hour 15 mark we ask her what the hell is going on, we get no real response. FINALLY we are at 1.5 hours and we are ready to walk, our friend goes and finds the manager and asks him whats going on and to please come talk to us. 2 minutes later the manager comes to our table with food! Yesssssss only its wrong, BOO :( They delivered 2 orders of stupid fries to the table, when we told him we only ordered one he said well we are just going to throw this away so keep it, which I am glad we did because it was going to still be a while for all the food to come out correctly. My friends order was the veggie plate, 2 of the 4 sides were wrong, then they tried to deliver the same wrong veggie plate again. She finally gets all of her food. meanwhile myself and a friend are STILL waiting for ours. Then he gets his and the manager says so that's it right??? Ummmm no...how about bringing the pregnant lady her food, eh? 
My food finally materializes and I am happy. The tell me that they are out of french fries but that they just cut up some potato's and made some fries, fine by me. My friend ordered the catfish and specifically asked the waitress for malt vinegar, she brings him out a cup of white vinegar....who does that? 

Ive been to both locations plenty of times and have never had this type of experience. It was seriously the worst....and to top that all off when our bill came there wasn't one bit of a discount on it, after all of that, everything we had been through, nothing. we were pretty disappointed in how the staff handled themselves.

He and I both unanimously decided that this place SUCKS. He told me ""you should have called me from the parking lot, I would have saved you a bunch of time and aggravation."" 

This is definitely one of those cases in which you should NEVER believe the hype.  

Over priced. $3 for KOOL AID! (Anybody that orders Kool aid for $3... I have some real estate I want to discuss with you) $16 for dry flavorless chicken and cinnamon waffles. Gimme a break. I can get an entire family meal of chicken at KFC for less than that! And the KFC actually is juicy and has flavor!

The fried chicken is flavorless. Seriously. Its like flour and a dash of salt. Thats it. NO seasonings at all. They talk about passing down recipes for generations and generation...? WHaaaaaa?  I wonder if while the recipe was being passed down, they deleted the spices to save money on the overpriced food they are selling to us bamboozled people out there... It honestly tastes like fried chicken from a Lubys cafeteria thats specifically cooked to cater to the older folks on restricted diets. 

The waffles were yummy. I will give em that. Cornbread was dry. 

It took over 30 minutes to get a burger. The rest of the meal came out in parts. They forgot some of it altogether till we asked for it.

We were there during the Sunday morning brunch rush, but the wait actually wasn't that bad.Unfortunately, the service, which wasn't great when it was the small house got much worse with the upgraded structure. The new building is great and the music really compliments the ambiance as well. Our drink order came out wrong (ice tea instead of hot tea) and when we told the server, she never fixed it. She took an additional 10 minutes to get our order after that. Once we got our meal, she never returned to ensure it was correct either. We asked for our check and ten minutes later she asked us if we wanted dessert and we had to ask for our check again. Eventually we got it from another server.

But... they did inform us that Lo-Lo's was open and it was not too far away... so off we went. 

They place was busy... and they sat us towards the back. But the service was crazy good!!! 

You really need to spend a few good minutes acquainting yourself with the menu. I was laughing my ass off at the menu items! ""Stupid Fries"", ""Phat Azz Samich"", ""Crazy Ghetto Mess"", ""A Jar Of Drank""! Just to name a few.

The best ""line"" of the night... my wife asks our waiter, ""How are the 'stupid fried'?"" His reply.... They're Stupid...............(long pause)..... GOOD!"" 

I stuck with the tried and true chicken and waffles. We shared at the table the candied yams, and the fried okra. Everything was amazing! It was my first time having chicken and waffles together.

Chicken was tender, crisp to perfection, and sultry.  Waffles were flaky and cinnamony.  Grits and the mac n cheese were creamy.  The greens had a major kick of spice to them and were not that spicy at the same time.  Corn bread was soft and crispy.  The cake was buttery yummy goodness.  And the Stupid Fries were, well, so good they will make you cross eyed.

First impressions are everything, so they say, and in this instance I would agree. Since moving here over a year ago I have heard people go on and on about Lolo's chicken and waffles, especially when they find out I moved from the south. ""Oh it is the best soul food"", ""They have the best fried chicken I have had anywhere.."" are some of the things people have said. We live in Mesa and there is not a location near us but this morning  we were running errands in Phoenix and drove about 15 minutes out of our way so I could finally try this place that so many people have raved about. The place was decorated nice, it was not too long after they opened and it was not busy, we were seated right away. Took about 10 minutes before we saw a server, our drinks were brought out fairly quick and our order taken. Our food came out pretty quick but what difference does quick service make when the food is cold? The skin on the chicken was not even crisp on the edges, they had obviously been sitting around for a while. I tried a bite anyway, good fried chicken is good hot or cold and this was not good. It had the overwhelming taste of flour and I think the cook forgot to put seasoning on it at all. When the waiter came over to check on us I told him the chicken was cold and I didn't want it, at first he took the plate back and didn't say anything at all, when he brought the check he apologized. I have heard people say how good it is and maybe my experience is isolated but if it really was an uncommon experience then why didn't the waiter seemed surprised when I returned it? Why didn't he offer to get me a fresh plate? Why didn't a manager come over to see what they problem was or to apologize? Maybe they are used to serving sub-standard food, that is the only thing I can think of. This place reminds me of a lot of places that were really good until they got popular, quality of food and service goes down, prices go up and the only reason they stay in business is because they are ""cool"" or trendy. 

Bottom line - Don't think I will try this place again, there are so many really good restaurants to try in the Phoenix area and when you are going to spend an average of $10+  per person to sit down & eat somewhere, the food should at least be fresh. 

Oh yeah, one more thing, a glass jar of kool-aid should never cost $3, unless you get to take the jar with you.",2,"[u' so many', u' fairly quick', u' pretty quick', u' quick service', u' overwhelming taste', u' uncommon experience', u' fresh plate', u' really good', u' so many', u' really good']",4.958333333,"[u' little waffle', u' greasy chicken', u' fried chicken', u' not good']",-1.7375

The wait = only 20 minutes on a Saturday morning at 10am. Rosco's would have been at least 45 minutes. 
The service = friendly and welcoming. They had no intention of rushing us out of there, even though there was a wait list at the host stand. I could tell that our server (Sarah, I think) wanted us to have a comfortable, relaxing meal. 
The food = Just as good as Rosco's (which means, superb!). I ordered the #10, which is two chicken legs and a waffle. The chicken was insanely buttery and moist, with perfect crispy crust. The waffle was short, flat, covered in butter, and accompanied by piping-hot syrup. That's exactly how I like it. 
I also asked our server for an order of her favorite side dish, and she brought me a side of collared greens, which were the best I've ever had. They were buttery, crisp, and somehow spicy. I asked one of the other employees how they got the spice, and he said it's crushed red pepper flakes, though he seemed unsure. Whatever it is, it's heaven.

I have driven by Lo-lo's many times. Having enjoyed chicken and waffles at the famous Roscoe's in LA years ago, I kept meaning to give this a try. The only trouble is unlike years ago, I'm now trying to avoid fried food, as well as wheat so the concept of eating fried bird and fried batter was a conundrum to say the least.
I decided after 6 months of staunch resistance to let my hair down and give Lo-Lo's a try.
I went for lunch on a weekday. The place is directly south of downtown, in a fairly sketchy area. Despite the location, it was PACKED! It's always busy. Here's why:
It's billed as a soul food place however there were guys in suits and ladies out for lunch and families and singles like myself. Good soul food attracts a diverse crowd. Seems we might solve the worlds problems by having everyone discuss international conflict with a belly full of soul food. 
The service from the moment I walked in was fast and friendly.  I got a table right away. My Server was a fun and spunky young woman named Jerri. She brought me an ice tea: huge mason jar! Seemed all the beverages are served this way to ensure no one needs endless refills. 
The menu is colorful and tongue in cheek, with plenty of Ebonics word play. Being 25% black, I managed. Though my Canuck heritage kinda cancels any of that out!
I opted for the standard 3-piece fried chicken meal with 2 sides. One has the gravy and onions option, but for my first visit I needed to taste the bird as it comes from the fryer! As I don't eat much carbs these days, I chose spicy collards and string beans with red potatoes.  
The food is delicious. It's not fancy. It's not trying to be something other than what it is: down home Southern delicious! The fact that most of the chicken and sides are ready to go back in the kitchen, I had my plate hot and in front of me in about 3mins flat!
I chose to eat the cornbread as the heck with the carbs my black side wanted that bread! I poured out some of Lo-Lo's signature hot sauce, added a bit of honey and it was on like Donkey Kong! I savored every crispy, spicy, delectable bite!
The way I eat chicken is pretty simple: If I can chew or crunch it, it's going down the chute: skin, meat, cartilage, wing-tips, you name it, it's gone! I love eating chicken with my wife cuz I get to eat twice once she's done. ""You're not finishing that?!"" I inquire looking at what to me amounts a 2/3 eaten morsel reaching for it...she has learned to simply look away and block out the chilling sounds of a carnivore devouring its crispy, salty prey.
Once I had finally eaten every possible scrap on my plate, Jerri came by and looking at the meager remains on my now barren plate, asked with a wry smile ""You gonna eat the bones too or are you finished?"" I said ""My only regret is that I don't have an extra stomach or I would order round 2!""
If you want a real down home, down south, downtown fried chicken experience with our without waffles, get you DOWN to Lo-Lo's. You'll be back!

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Approaching the hostess stand as I looked around the newly designed space I was quick to find that much like my surroundings the service too at Lo Lo's was far superior to Roscoe's and led by one smiling face at the podium to another at my table towards the back it would not be long before a menu was in hand, water was filled, and a few daily specials were noted - the whole process taking less than five minutes and my order placed within ten, much to my waiter's delight as he noted ""man, you ordered all the best stuff - I hope you brought your appetite.""

Sitting and watching the games as the restaurant's hustle and bustle continued my neighbors struck up a conversation with me stating that they had been coming to Lo-Lo's ""every few weeks since the day it opened"" and admitting it was my first time they suggested it definitely wouldn't be my last and within moments of the arrival of my meal I knew they were right as every single item that landed on my table looked excellent; the first being a single $3.50 ""Aunt Hattie's Salmon Croquette"" featuring a crispy external batter surrounding flaky salmon and studded with green onions.  Apparently a traditional southern recipe but one I'd not previously encountered I was told that these were best with a splash of Lo-Lo's ""famous"" hot sauce and although I generally prefer to avoid condiments I must say my neighbors were right as the acidity of the sauce really helped to bring out some of the more briny notes from the salmon while breading remained crunchy with minimal grease.

Moving next to my main plate, the $14 Soulfood Platter with Chicken Fried Chicken, a golden waffle, macaroni and cheese, plus a round of cornbread it would be hard to find a gripe with this dish save for, maybe, those who like their mac n' cheese a little over-baked and with a bit of crunch.  Featuing a double dipped and friend boneless, skinless breast alongside a bowl of intense and peppery sausage gravy the chicken here was definitely the star of the show with each bite juicy and full of crunch but largely devoid of any oil whatsoever.  Nicely spiced and with the gravy further gilding the lily I next turned my attention to the waffle, also crisp but intensely buttery with a good amount of 'give' at the center and while pure maple syrup would have been ideal in the end the Mrs. Butterworth's was fine - the sweetness tempered by the chicken, gravy, and macaroni.  Last but not least, the cornbread crowned with a mound of butter was textbook - a little dry, not too sweet, and good both on its own or as a transition between the plate's other components.

Making short work of the Soulfood plate my primary server, Joseph, stopped by to say ""nice job"" and asking if I had room for dessert I think he was surprised when I said yes - and even more surprised when I ordered two; one for here, one to go, and both eliciting a slow whistle from the gentleman to my left who said to his wife ""that boy can eat"" - and much like the savories what I ate next would be outstanding.

Beginning first with the lesser known of Lo-Lo's signature desserts, a house made banana puddin' served in a hefty mason jar and topped with an airy dollop of whipped cream - at $5 this is probably the steal of the menu as the container must have contained twenty spoonful of the rich parfait.  At times rife with the fructose of banana and at times mellowed by whipped cream or saturated Nilla wafers with plenty of textural nuance added by crumbles and chunks of unsoaked cookie this was precisely my kind of dessert; high end ingredients or not, I love pudding.

Realizing I couldn't (or a least shouldn't) leave Lo-Lo's without trying their oft raved ""Sandy Sand's Red Velvet Cake"" and knowing I could (but shouldn't) have eaten it while I was still seated at 10 Yuma Street I asked for a piece to be boxed up and although it wasn't pretty, the results were just as good as many have suggested - the cake moist, dense, and loaded with cocoa while the cream cheese icing is slick but not too sweet and nicely tempered by the pecans.  Generally one to fancy cupcakes over sliced cakes mostly because I prefer there to be more cooked surface area and thus more 'sponge' I was particularly interested to see the open baking window as I left the restaurant where the team was assembling the cakes from large springform pans thus allowing the layers to each have more exposure and thus explaining the excellent texture.  For my money I'd go with the puddin', but this is one damned fine Red Velvet, and in the context of the experience that is Lo-Lo's Chicken and Waffles either make a great finale to a great meal in an unexpected but excellent setting.",5,"[u' far superior', u' hot sauce', u' more briny', u' golden waffle', u' Nicely spiced', u' good amount', u' pure maple', u' too sweet', u' primary server', u' nice job', u' more surprised', u' rich parfait', u' as good', u' too sweet', u' particularly interested', u' excellent texture', u' damned fine', u' great finale', u' great meal', u' excellent setting']",10.30595238,"[u' minimal grease', u' peppery sausage']",-0.2

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Based on the positive Yelp reviews we decided to give this place a try and were really disappointed.

First, I let my wife out on the curb to inquire how long the wait was, we were told 20 minutes so I found a place to park across the street and decided to wait the 20 minutes since we had came all the way from Goodyear. Stood waiting for 45 minutes and noticed people that came after us being seated so went up and looked at the waiting list and they had skipped us and been seating people after us with parties of 3 and 4 at tables with four chairs and left us waiting for one of the couple tables of only 2 chairs since there was only two of us. I got upset at the gal running the waiting list and she said ""you're next"" then proceeded to sit 4 more parties before us before we were finally seated at a table with 4 chairs since a table for 2 never opened up.

That was strike one.

Next, with the name ""Chicken and Waffles"" I expected to have some good waffles and figured they would be BIG. I ordered 3 chicken wings and 1 waffle for $10.50 and was very disappointed when this little thin waffle came out with 3 little tiny chicken wings. I get bigger wings when be buy fried chicken at the deli counter of Fry's grocery stores. I thought about ordering another waffle but seen they wanted $4 for just a tiny waffle and said screw that. I walked away still hungry.

The chicken had good flavor but the waffle was tiny and soggy and a frozen waffle out of box would have been just as impressive as this waffle.

We were at the place for nearly 2.5 hours and the bill for two of us was right at $30 for lunch and both of us were still hungry when we left. Not worth the price or the wasted time to eat here.

The southern fried chicken was crunchy, tasty, finger lickin' good (take that KFC)...and the thin buttery waffle also had a nice crisp edge, although next time I'm gonna try for extra crispy waffles...the mac & cheese was velvety smooth & rich...my first bite of rice & beans was an epiphany - the savory sauce was a perfect contrast against the sweetness of the waffles and crusty corn muffin - I now know that I have never truly had rice and beans before Lo-Lo's.

But my favorite was actually the fried catfish...dusted with cornmeal for a dry (not oily) crunch into oh-so tender flaky catfish.  I would have loved to order another one, but I was bursting.  However, as I went up to pay, I could not help but notice that luscious hunk of Red Velvet cake slathered with cream cheese frosting and studded with walnut...I gave into the siren call and ordered a piece to take home.

The waffles are dusted with cinnamon and melt in your mouth.  The cheese grits are wonderfully authentic to a southern girl such as myself, and let's be honest, who in their right mind would ever complain about a freakin' Mason Jar filled to the brim with delicious kool-aid.

LoLo's is that good, only sober, and in the morning.  Show up there at 955am on a Sunday and you'll see a line of brothas in their sunday best waiting to get in to this place.  And where that line of people goes, I will blindly follow.

Because inside you'll find: mason jars (!) of red Kool-Aid, good ol' fashioned Southern sweet tea, or whatever soda you want.  But then there's the plate of fried chicken.  Top it off with red rooster sauce and life is damn good.

Alternatives: mac and cheese

The waffles are good but to be honest with you, I feel like they just get in the way of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.  (Sober or drunk)  I mean, you wouldn't just go to the original pancake house and get only eggs and hash browns, would you?  Only a goddamn fool would do that.  No, you are the person that goes to Mastro's for the steak, Sapporo for the teppan yaki, and Red Lobster for the, well, red lobster.  (you know what I mean...)  And since you are that person, go to LoLo's.  Get a jar of drink and eat so much chicken that you want to die.  It's a good feeling.",5,"[u' good ol', u' damn good', u' original pancake', u' good feeling']",2.475,"[u' fried chicken', u' fried chicken']",-1.2
YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"This was the second place I requested to go on our trip to Arizona. My boyfriend isn't as into Soul Food as I am, but he ended up loving it as much as I did! We arrived around 11:45 on Saturday morning and there was a short wait to be seated.

Once seated everything happened very fast. Everybody who works here is very friendly and we were constantly checked on. We both ordered a ""jar of drank,"" Sweet Tea. It was really good. I could taste lots of honey in it. Yum! They also offer to go cups so I was able to take it with me when we left.

My boyfriend ordered Nay Nay's breakfast, two waffles, two eggs, and a bowl of grits. His waffles were delicious, loaded with cinnamon. Loved those. I usually don't like grits, but they were good here. There was so much butter on them, I don't know how somebody couldn't like them!

I went with the Lolo's Famous Soul Food Platter, and I chose three pieces of fried chicken, mac & cheese, and smothered potatoes. This platter is also served with a piece of cornbread. I knew it would be way too much food, but I wanted to try it all. Everything was perfect! The chicken was super juicy, the skin was crispy and salty and exactly what I was hoping it would be. The mac & cheese was flavorful and very cheesy. The smothered potatoes were great, chunks of potatoes swimming in a very peppery gravy with some peppers and onions. And the cornbread was great too, very sweet.

The restaurant is bright and airy and they played awesome music the entire time we were here. The bathroom was very clean. The outdoor patio area was really cute. If I lived in Phoenix I would be here all the time! We were both really glad we stopped by here for lunch, we left full and happy.

I ordered the #1 (KK's) - the chicken and waffles were both pretty good, but both fell short of Roscoe's here in LA. The chicken was a bit dry and just didn't have enough flavor and the waffles didn't have that hint of cinnamon that Roscoe's has. The grits were good and I really enjoyed the scrambled eggs with cheese and onions... just wish they gave more than two bites of it.

I initially didn't like their gravy, but I grew into it as I continued to eat. It was sweeter than I was used to, but it went well with the food.

Walk in and the waiting area has several nice pieces of art displayed as well as a book section where you can enjoy a quick read in kind of a coffee house atmosphere.  If you have time.  The guy and the girl who were working staff were quick, polite, helpful and cheery.  We were seated right away.  Service was prompt and lightening fast, but I went before the noon rush with only 4 other parties when we arrived and 3 more that came along after us.  So I imagine it changes, YMMV

I had the Lil' Amadi combo opting for two thighs and a waffle plus a large Sweet Tea.  Chicken was great, flavorful and juicy but not too salty and the waffles crispy and tasty - cooked just right.  The Massive Kern mason jar of sweet tea was never empty thanks to prompt staff workers.  
Total of mine came in at $10.38, then I tipped 20%.  Fair fare price - LOL!

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Tips:

The Kool-Aid is GIGANTIC. (Tropical Punch, Blue Raspberry, and 1 other flavor)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

My boyfriend and I shared the chicken gizzards, 1 thigh & 1 drumstick combo with 1 waffle, and the shrimp and grits. The Shrimp and Grits took a while to come out since it's made fresh so I wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're crunched for time to catch a flight out like me.

Overall, the food was delicious and I don't think you could go wrong with anything here at Lo-Lo's. The waffle has a cinnamon taste to it that I am sure is unique to Lo-Lo's, it's amazing. Do not skip the waffles!

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"I had a fever and the the only thing to cure it was... more LoLo's chicken and waffles!
I was actually there with Dave R. because we had a hankering for fried chicken. We both ordered #3's along with the red Kool-Aid. I opted for beans over rice and Dave had the fried okra. 
The chicken came out nice and hot with just the right amount of crispyness that's not from too much batter or coating, but from the right amount of frying. The waffles were the perfect compliment. The right amount of sweetness along with the heaping spoonfull of butter on top. The rice and beans were knid of put off to the side because of the ""main event"" but were tasty none the less.
My only concern was the sweetness of the Kool-Aid. I couldn't remember the last time I had Kool-Aid, but I never remembering it being this sugary. Maybe my mom had the right idea and only put 1 cup of sugar in to mix. What, the recipe only calls for one cup?
This was my 4th visit to LoLo's since moving out here last year. I was a regular at Roscoe's in Long Beach, CA and the only difference is in the waffle. Roscoe's puts cinamon in their waffle batter that gives it a unique taste.

As we were getting ready to leave and pay the bill, the staff became rude. One man told us he couldnt have a crowd of 80 trying to pay at the same time. He sent us back to our table to have someone come and help us. After that they told us they could only split the bill in two, which meant that none of us got the correct change.

well damn Dirty Red was right! i had the Betty Boop, mac n' cheese and cornbread. my sister the BB too, but with string beans and potatoes (they tasted like they were in a pork broth very tasty).

the chicken was so moist, while fried to perfection! the waffle was thin with buckwheat (i think) and cinnamon. i'm not usually a waffle fan, but this waffle was amazing. the mac n' cheese was so yummy i literally cleaned my plate (my only complaint was the small serving-but i'm sure they knew it was just the right amount) the homefries were great, fried to a perfect golden brown with perfectly soft potatoes on the inside, they melted in my mouth. 

our only  complaint was the bad service (which i really think is only part of the overall dining experience) we were served our drinks at sporadic times, presented with our food and no utensils (i got up to request some, and 5 minutes later Dirty Red had to get up to request some). but ya know what, it wasn't enought to taint my meal...i just picked up my plump chicken breast and went to town, the waffle had to wait.

The sponge was moist, and the frosting wasn't overbearing, but just the perfect punctuation to a well-crafted sentence.

Now, I must be honest and say that the reason I am not giving the restaurant 5 stars is because I came back for Brunch the next day -- a Sunday. I was very excited to return, mainly to have the Biscuits and Gravy, and sadly, I was underwhelmed. Not only did it take an exorbitantly long time for the food to arrive, but when it did, it appeared as if it had been sitting under heating lamps for quite some time. Not to mention, the flavor profile was not nearly as intense as my previous meal there. Might I suggest to this establishment to start taking reservations.

Being the fat kid that I am, I also ordered a side of smothered potatoes, ie: roasted taters drenched in their homemade gravy. FYES! FTW! I also got Kool-aid. In a mason jar. Why did I ever stop drinking the stuff? I don't know. Memories of childhood immediately flooded my mind along with a 5 hour long sugar high. I probably gained 5 pounds, but whatever.. This food takes you into instant Utopia, followed by an instant food coma. I think we had about 5 different servers as well, but how can you complain about that? They were on top of their game!

Do not come here if you are trying to eat healthy or have issues with cholesterol and/or get annoyed with really loud drunk/hungover people (depending on the time of day you come, sometimes they're open till 3am). Oh, and don't even worry about the location, safe no, sketch yes, worth it, absolutely.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,This is a great place to eat. The menu has improved a lot and the quality of the food is always the same. The koolaid is a must have any flavor. The only reason for 4star because service is pretty slow. I had went on a Wednesday about 6:40pm. We set down right away. Ordered right away but our food did not come out till 7:50 a hour 10mina later. The waitress was pleasant and stopped by to let us know it will be out shortly. Hour wait on food was a little to long we had a child and they can barely set still for 10mins let alone over hour waiting on food. Not sure if they was short cooks but it was not extremely busy in the restaurant that's only reason 4stars.,4,[u' great place'],0.8,[u' Not sure'],-0.25

Food was just ok. The chicken was pretty flavorful but inconsistent. I got one small leg and then a giant breast the size of a football. How they fried that sucker to be fully cooked is a mystery. The waffles are like Eggos. Nothing mind blowing. Maybe we've been spoiled with our homemade Belgian waffles.

Lo-Lo's was just alright for me.  

I liked the chicken, but I was not fond of the waffles.  They were a little too... thin?  Light?  I dunno how to describe it, but I like my chicken AND my waffles to have a little crunch.  And there was kind of an interesting taste to the waffles.  I can't put my finger on the flavor.

I liked the atmosphere okay, but I probably won't be back.

I know Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe is not for everyone, but honestly I prefer the feel there.  It feels less ""affected"" by its customers, I guess.  For some reason I am finding it hard to come up with the words here, but Lo Lo's feels like it is the more popular cousin of Mrs. White's... you know... the one with the Letter in Football.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Came to Lo Lo's to see what all the hype is about. I've been to Roscoe's multiple times and wanted to see if it compared. Truthfully I was not impressed with this experience. Came with a party of 6 for Sunday morning brunch. We had an hour wait which surprisingly was a little bit faster then quoted  which was great. I got the chicken breast and waffle and a side of Mac and cheese which Is generally my usual at Roscoe's. The waffle was thin and smelled fresh and yummy. The chicken was in the small side which is fine for me seeing as I still had a whole waffle and Mac and cheese. When I tasted the chicken it was extremely dry. My sister's chicken wasn't as dry as mine, but still I was a little disappointed. With each bite I took I was in need of a beverage to wash it down with. Unfortunately, I got sweet tea and that was hands down the most disgusting sweet tea of my life! The saying ""Would you like some Tea with that Sugar"" comes to mind. I had to dilute it with water and even then I couldn't drink the pure sugar... We get it, you serve over sugared homemade drinks... But seriously, You're better off getting water or soda which both options contain less sugar then their sweet tea or kool-aid. Anyway, When they initially brought out our food they didn't bring out my side, I asked the waiter about the Mac and he apologized and said it would be out right away. A few minutes later he asked if I ever got it and said he would get it himself; in which he did and was super apologetic about it. He was a sweet guy. The Mac and cheese was plain, it tastes doughy to me, almost bland. The waffle was okay, I put light syrup and ate it, I don't have much to rave about for it was just a regular waffle... I still prefer a Waffle House waffle or Roscoe's... 
My cousin got chicken smothered in gravy, I tasted the gravy and it was pure amazingness! I instantly wished I would have ordered it. The gravy tastes like bell peppers and other spices, very yummy! 
My other family members ordered the chorizo plate which was a big serving alongside tortillas which everyone tasted and loved. Also, another family member got the biscuits and gravy. Another must, the serving size was big and the biscuits were on point! 

Parking is. Pain, they have a small lot but you can park a block away in the neighborhood. The location inside is clean and decorated very nice and authentic looking. I've read other reviews and hears the service sucks, so I guess we got lucky And got some great help. 

Do I recommend it? Meh, I would say sure Go it if you want to try it out. Specifically my food was not that good but from everyone else's food I tried it was good, and I personally would come back only to try their other dinner options...

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Huge portions. A little out of control to be honest. If you're staying in downtown Phoenix, then I suggest you do the 30 minute one way walk. 

Grits were exactly how they listed them- plain. With a slab of margarine. I prefer butter. And they really were gritty no smoothness. Eggs were fried in margarine as well. So I'd stay away from it next time. 

A lot of carbs: waffles were soggy. They need to stand up to the chicken but didn't. Brother ordered the biscuits and they were giant fist sized and smothered in gravy. 

Chicken with their hot sauce was the best thing there. Definitely would advise to stick with just the chicken unless you're a fan of margarine and/or massive amounts of carbs. I love the concept of chicken and waffles (live in LA with the famous Roscoe's, which I don't recommend either) but the waffles always seems to disappoint. It's chicken and waffles. Not chicken with pancakes.

I chose to valet the car of course. Too lazy to walk, lol. It was steady and busy for a Sunday. The wait was about 30 minutes. Walking in though it was like a whole new atmosphere. The place was bigger than last time I seen it, so there was ample room. We got seated in the booth. I forgot who was our waiter, shame on me, but they were very pleasant and nice. We all ordered the smothered chicken and man it was DELICIOUS. It definitely hit the spot. The chicken even though it was smothered with the creamy gravy and onions still had a little crunch to it which was good still. I added some hot sauce to it and it just made this plate to die for.

Waffles were hot and fresh. Poured some syrup all over it and I couldn't ask for anything more.

She hadn't tried it since we had a bad experience in New Orleans but got brave enough to have it here and was very pleased with it. The grits were creamy just like she likes them and the shrimp and sauce were excellent. I hear it gets busy later on in the day but we went for lunch and were seated right away.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"I cried.

I pushed the passenger car seat back, unbuttoned my jeans and if I could have unbuttoned my skin, I would have. We had an emergency stop at Wal-Greens for Lactaid, Tums, Bean-O, and Ginger Ale. I even made my bf buy this hideous stained glass candle holder (at WAL-GREENS) cause I thought it was ""cute""-that is how out of my mind w/pain I was. I laid down on the bed and asked for a barf bucket. Just in Case. And did you see what I gave this place? Yeah. Five muthaf'n stars. Don't be a pussy. 

I racked my brain all day, trying to come up with a good Phoenix-y place to bring my BFs dad who had driven all the way from Bakersfield and was surely hungry. We needed a place that at 8:30 on a Friday gonna be open and not insane. He is a down home, steak and taters guy, and I am a nervous nelly sophisticate whose lactose intolerance and mostly vegetarian tummy stumps restaurants . And I was hungry after a long day of work. I looked up the menu at work and saw they serve b-fest all day. Oh good, this way I could avoid all the meat, get the waffle, and avoid all ""oh, you don't like meat"" conversation I hate.

Easy enough to find (take the 60 to 17 if you can to avoid Light Rail hell from the 10), we found parking on the street and walked right into the restaurant after seeing the bright neon sign with a mighty Sassy Chicken on front! We were seated immediately (I have no idea what people were talking about regarding the wait- we were lucky is all I can wager) in the same room Kristin C. was: the only four person table besides a two person one, where they have the soda machine, extra canola oil, cash register and silver ware and the kitchen where the amiable cooks sauntered out drinking sweet tea and eating the food. I liked the little hutch over our table with various black studies books. I liked the famous signatures tagged all over the place. 

I looked over the two-paged laminated menus-and was stumped. I forgot they had fish tooo....and sides...and omg. I guess the staff is used to a long decision making process, cause they hooked us up on the mason jars of sweet tea (holy shit is it GOOOooooOOOD). We all decided on the platter since it affords you two sides WITH cornbread, and the platter rings in only at $12.50 for battered chicken (3 pieces) or Codfish or Catfish with two sides and cornbread...whhaaaa-considering most sides are at like 3.50...I got the cod (go MA pride!), waffle, collard greens, cornbread. Tim got the chicken, waffle, home fries and his dad got catfish, waffle and homefries. After placing the order (I was gonna get fried okra but since the greens aren't cooked with ham, I went for 'em), it came within ten minutes-like FAST.

We all dove right into the waffle (I scooped off the butter immediately on to a separate dish in hopes of saving myself a little) and all agreed it was the best waffle ever.

""This waffle is good.""

""Yes, it is""

""Oh my...I just had the waffle and it is GOOD.""

five minutes later

""This waffle is really, really good.""

ten minutes later

""I can't believe how perfect this waffle is""

It was like fucking Groundhog Day with this waffle, I couldn't picture a better waffle-not too doughy, not too nutmegy, not too crispy, not too buttermilky, not too cinammonly, not too eggy, not too airy, the little waffle indents weren't too deep or shallow for optimal warmed maple syrup lovin', and I ate the whole damn waffle. My lil' waffle of doom.

I could only manage to eat one piece of Cod (it was as big as my face) and the crunchy, flavourful (but oddly not spicy) batter was perfect with the hot sauce on the table. The cornbread a moist muffin of pure delish-a real compliment, not a star, but a perfect compliment to the rest of the palate. I loved my collared greens and it was spicy, and vaguely sweet, and I ate it gingerly it was that good. In fact even thought I stuffed myself, I still had a whole piece of cod, a 3/4 of a cornbread muffin, and almost huge bowl of collard greens left over.

We really wanted that red velvet cake so seductive under the glass dome case on the counter, but as we sat there drinking our refills, the pain started and the dreaminess and sleepiness and regret. 

Our guest loved it, kept complimenting me on it (and didn't notice my bizarre eating habits), Tim mentioned if he lived near by he would gain 5,000 pounds, and I can't wait to come back on a weekday early afternoon to have brunch w/the waffle and GRITS...yummers!!!!!!",5,"[u' surely hungry', u' mostly vegetarian', u' bright neon', u' sweet tea', u' famous signatures', u' sweet tea', u' really good', u' hot sauce', u' perfect compliment', u' vaguely sweet', u' almost huge']",5.6,"[u' little hutch', u' black studies', u' holy shit']",-0.554166667

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"I am writing a poor review of Lolo's based primarily on the poor service that I received. I think I would have enjoyed my experience more if I hadn't been treated so poorly.

The place was busy when I came, but there was no wait and I was seated immediately. After being seated, I checked in on Yelp and waited for a server. None came. No one even acknowledged my existence. I looked at my Yelp check in time and 15 minutes had passed. I went to the hostess and asked what I needed to do to get a server. Rather than apologize, she made an excuse and said that the server was busy. I hate when people make excuses. Just apologize and fix the problem please. The hostess got me some tea and then the server came immediately. I ordered fried green tomatoes and chicken. Main course arrived almost immediately. Maybe 5 minutes after I ordered. The tomatoes, no where to be seen. I mentioned the tomatoes to the server and they showed up at my table when I was  halfway finished with the meal. I had planned on desert, I wanted to try the pudding, but the waitress brought me the bill before I was finished with the main course without offering desert. I asked her where I needed to go to order desert. She stared at me blankly and said, ""oh, you want desert?"" I told her no, it seems that it would be too much of a bother.

I will never return. I think if I had gotten an apology for the service then I would have been a bit appeased. No apology was offered by anyone. Not the hostess, not the server, nor management.

As for the food, I think if I were placed in a blind taste test between Lolo's and KFC, I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. Maybe it's because the service left such a terrible taste in my mouth, but I will never return to find out.

The only positives to my experience was that I liked the atmosphere and the waitress kept my glass full, which is the only reason I tipped her.

Things I've tried there:

LoLo's special which is 3 piece of chicken with 2 waffles, Stupid fries, side of potatoes smothered, Chyna's honey hots (which are their hotwings), Ivan's chorizo and eggs, and their banana cream pudding.

Their chicken is perfectly cooked.  Nice, crunchy, juicy, and very flavorful.  Their waffles are fantastic as well, but my all time favorite has got to be their Stupid Fries.  It's a basket of freshly cooked french fries smothered in gravy with bits of bell peppers, onions, and chunks of their fried chicken.  I have no idea how they do it but even though their fries are smothered, it stays extra crispy under all that sauce.  That's what makes it so darn delicious.  It's definitely a meal in itself.  Their banana cream pudding is so large you guys can share it.  Banana cream anything is one of my favorites so of course I would say that it was amazing!!

Their koolaide are awesome as well.  You can't come here and not have their koolaide.  I love their blue but I sometime switch it up to red.  My fiance and I have tried their Scottsdale location as well but I feel that the cook at the Phoenix location (which is the original) has got it down packed.

I ordered a arnold palmer with sweet tea and my friends got grape and red koolaid. All the drinks were great and served in some pretty large mason jars. The Arnold palmer with it's mix of sweet flavors and bitter bite of lemon was a great way to wake up and get some fluids of the non-alcoholic kind.

For food I got the Baby Ray's which is chicken covered in gravy and onions and some waffles. It was great the chicken was super moist inside and the flavors of the chicken, gravy and waffles make a savory bite that was as pleasing to the stomach as it was the tongue.  The gravy was just enough to cover the chicken but not so much it was too much. The waffles have a spice in them that i think is nutmeg but makes very flavorful on it's own without syrup. 

The meal was exactly what i needed to get me up and back to normal...sadly it was so good I ate so much I needed a glorious food coma to recover.

Mac:  some of the best traditional MnC I've ever had.  If you want a fancy one, then try the one at the Yardhouse in Scottsdale, but I digress.  The MnC was as dense as a brick, and it was super, super cheesy.  

Greens:  very good, well flavored, but they were served with a bit too much liquid.  I like a little bit drier, but they still had great flavor.  An excellent complement to the chicken, waffle, and MnC.

I didn't know what to expect. I knew that the food would probably be good. That it was in a ghetto part of town. Not to be on a diet before I got here. The basics. 

I was really quite impressed. They had clearly renovated recently. It's bright and stylish and modern. Very busy, and quite loud, thanks to the crowd of people and aforementioned DJ.

You can't have a soul food place, without the folks who invented soul food.  WTH?

But, alas, my fears were washed away.  Apparently, they were smart and showed up early, before Lo-Lo's opened, to get out of the heat and seated quickly.  Gotta remember that the next time because there is no waiting indoors.  You either gotta stand under a tiny 8x8 tent they set up or along the side of the building in the alley way.

The waffle was great, too.  Slightly crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  

I have to admit, this place is waaay better than Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles.  Though, I've been a fan of theirs for years, the quality has slipped and the chicken was, more times than not, overcooked.  They're getting kicked to the curb.  Lo-Lo's is now my favorite chicken and waffle place.

The cornbread was better than I remembered. I noticed they changed their gravy also. The color is different... more golden than before with little specks of something red. It used to be a light brown gravy with peices of wilted onions. While still good, I liked the old version better. The sweet tea was a little sweeter than normal but I still enjoyed it.

For Lo-Lo's, though, I had to make an exception; their soul food is too damn delicious for only one serving.

I'm a big fan of the chicken and waffle combo, and was a regular at Roscoe's Chicken & Waffles former Oakland location. I hate to denigrate the original, but Lo-Lo's takes Roscoe's formula and runs away with it.

First, their chicken is very, very good. Crispy skin, moist interior, just the right amount of spices. My only beef is I wish the pieces were slightly larger.

Second, the waffles are excellent and topped with an enormous round of butter. Just they way they should be. Crisp, dripping with butter, delightful.

Third, the sides... oh, lord, the sides. The collard greens are the best greens I've ever eaten, and I've had my fair share of good ones. Cooked perfectly, no bitterness. They make the south proud. The cheese grits are a bowl of cheesy, well cooked goodness and are not to be missed. The mac 'n' cheese was smooth, and bathing in cheese sauce (and did I detect some velveeta in the mix? oh, I believe I did! And this, my friends, is a very good thing), and the cheese eggs were fluffy and perfectly proportioned between eggs, cheese and onions.

Finally, the red velvet cake is an absolute must-- no matter how stuffed you may be. If I could be encased in the frosting I would die a happy young lady.

My only regret in going to Lo-Lo's was my lack of stomach capacity. Now I'll have to wait a year before I try their fish, peas, and other sumptuous looking offerings.

Word to the wise-- as other reviewers have said, get there early. The folks who run Lo-Lo's are nice as can be and get your food to you in a hurry, but the place is small and it fills up quick. We were in by 10:30 on two separate weekdays and got the last available table both times. Otherwise, you're setting up outside in line.

Location: SUCKS. I thought my GPS was malfunctioning when it told me I had arrived at my destination. Hole in the wall shack on the corner of a busy street across from a fenced up empty lot. There goes the ambiance.  

Actual Restaurant: Too small and cramped. Very mediocre looking. Lots of signage written in Ebonics, menu items had ghetto names, Kool Aid flavors (Who puts Kool Aid on a menu and charges $2 for some colored sugar water?!) were Blue Raspberry, Tropical Punch, and Red....WTF is RED?!  

Employees: Cordial. Wouldn't say friendly. One copped an attitude when I told her this place was just like Roscoes.

The Food: I had the Sheedahs Special (1 breast 1 wing 1 waffle) and a side of Mac and cheese. The chicken was very salty. Salt does not equal flavor. The waffle was DELICIOUS. Just like Roscoes. The macaroni and cheese I was appalled by. How dare someone use cream of mushroom soup to make Mac and cheese with! That's a cheap way to make it creamy. I was sickened. 2 bites and I was done.

My husband and I take most of our out-of-state guest to Lolo's for the experience; friendly staff, Kool- aid served in mason jars, beers in brown bags and the food of course! There is ALWAYS a wait of at least 30 mins, which we don't mind, it's worth the wait. Well today we had the WORST experience ever. We walked out! First an hour wait, okay Sunday afternoon understandable. Finally we were seated, only to wait some more;10 minutes and no server has come to take our drink order or even say ""I'm you're server and I'll be back for your drink order."" I asked the hostess Destiny for a manager. Destiny was gracious enough to take our drink order and finally someone comes to check on us and take our order. We asked for China hot wings, the phat azz samich, 2 chicken tender baskets with a waffle and the steak and eggs.  5 mins later our wings come out. 20 mins later and still no food and people who were seated like 20 mins after us are getting their food. WTF! At this point my husband is pissed he got up talked to our server came back to the table left 20$ and we left. 
We have NEVER, even during busier hours, have had such bad service at Lolo's. If the kitchen is slow and behind the server could have let us know come by the table and offer refills. Nope we didn't even get that. The server even followed us outside because we were short (I ordered a mimosa) the audacity! Anyway it's gonna be a long long while before we go back to Lolo's.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"For a long time I dreamed of going to Lo-Lo's.  I'd heard about it from others like some sort of ancient mythology - it sounds amazing and fantastical but you know it can't really be true.  When it comes to Lo-Lo's - believe the hype.

Finding Lo-Lo's: I've driven down Central SO many times and never known how close I really was.  Then one day I saw an arrow spray painted on the side of the building.  ""Lo-Lo's this way!""  It took a few minutes to realize that that must be THE Lo-Lo's.  I started talking about it w/ friends and we decided we needed to go.  I confirmed the address and the 3 of us set off for flavor adventure.  Yes, you turn at the arrow (Which you only see when driving North on Central) and it's not much at all past that - but don't expect any huge signs, valet service - or even a parking lot.  You'll park right out on the street - and on a busy night that means you may need to walk a bit.

Entering Lo-Lo's:  Stepping through the doors = Waiting area.  Taking 2 steps into Lo-Lo's = Standing in front of someone's table while they are eating.  You can tell this used to be someone's house - and it was a small house at that.  There are just a few ""rooms"" for seating - and the largest has 5 tables.  Our first time there we sat in the room that has just two tables - a 4 and a 2 top - but it's also where the cash register is, where folks pick up to go orders, where they refill the drinks/silverware, where they store extra items that were purchased in bulk and has the doorway to the kitchen and you have to walk through that room to get to the other rooms.  In some places you might think this was the worst table in the house.  At Lo-Lo's I would disagree with you.  We got to listen in on the best conversations and we had the best view of all the amazing food going to the different rooms.  

The Food:  Sweet Tea served in a big Mason Jar.  SOLD!  It was awesome and the refills kept coming.  Soul Food without Sweet Tea is just wrong to me.  As for the rest of the Menu - it's not 30 pages long - in fact I'm pretty sure it's just one piece of paper written on both sides.  And yet it's still SO hard to choose.  The first time we went each of us got something slightly different.  Both my eating companions got some version of a meal that included both Chicken and Waffles.  I bucked the trend and got their Salmon Croquettes with Cheese Eggs, Grits and Waffles.  I could talk for days about how amazing their food is.  Best Eggs I'd ever had.  I am not a big egg person and I was craving these eggs again for a month.  The more I think about them the more I want to go.  The Salmon was amazing - I took one home and it was big enough I made myself a sandwich with it the next day.  The sides are all absolutely amazing.  The Greens have an amazing sweetness aftertaste that I am completely unable to describe.  The Chicken.  Oh, the Chicken.  Let's start w/ this.  I've always thought fried chicken was ""ok"".  I went with 2 folks who love fried chicken - and make their own family handed down recipes.  After their first bites it looked like they had found the holy grail.  It was the best fried chicken I'd ever eaten.  Guess what I've saved for last?  The waffles.  I always eat waffles or pancakes last for 2 reasons 1) They are SO sweet just like a desert and 2) I can only eat a few bites worth.  They are usually too sweet, too sticky, and very quickly mushy.  So, I spread around the butter (removing most of it of course) and drizzled it with some syrup.  It was the lightest, yummiest, buttery heavenly thing I'd ever had.  These were not just waffles.  These were Waffles.  I ate almost the whole thing.  As for Lo-Lo's desert menu - I've heard great things about their Red Velvet cake - but I've never quite been able to get that far into my meal and still order more.  Maybe next time.

Service: We've always had great service.  Servers are usually young and have that ""I'm working at my uncle's restaurant for the summer"" quality - but they are fast, knowledgeable and quick on the refills. 

Atmosphere: If you are from certain parts of the valley - Lo-Lo's may be a bit of a culture shock.  Yes, it is quite possible if you are of the Caucasian persuasion - you may be the only one there during your entire meal.  I've heard some folks say they would be ""afraid"" to go because of that.  My thought?  Get the heck over it.  Should a black person be afraid to go to AZ 88 or Flemings because they might be the only black person there?  Heck no.  And wouldn't you think they were silly for even thinking it?  Exactly.

Overall: Prices are good.  I honestly can't remember how much anything costs.  I blame the food.  But I do remember thinking ""wow, is that all?"" every time we go.  Location is downtown - just minutes from AWA.  Food is out of this freaking world.

Short Story- 
Good Service and Good Crispy Seasoned Fried Chicken and Good Waffles but some of the other items not so good. The portions are crazy big and might satisfy GODZILLA.

Long Story-
This pack was PACKED with people early at lunch time. The hostess informed us that it would be a half hour wait and her prediction was very accurate as it was. We ordered and our server brings out our beverages in large canning jars. We wait and wait and then our server informs us that the kitchen is backed up and it will be a while for our food to arrive. So we wait and wait and were are real hungry by now. Our food does eventually arrive sometime after a half hour.

I received a soul food platter. You have many choices on how to build your platter and I picked a chicken thigh, a fish, and two sides. This platter also comes with a corn bread.

Chicken- Good! Crispy Skin, Seasoned Nice, Moist!

Fish- Awful- Served broken in half, over cooked with a terrible ultra thick corn meal coating that might have been a 1/3 of an inch thick. 

Macaroni and cheese- so-so-better than average for processed tasting cheese. Strong process cheese taste but doctored up well. Pasta was slightly over cooked. I note that I don't care for processed tasting Macaroni and Cheese. I know that most people only eat and make it that way so you might feel different than me depending on your taste.

Spicy Green Beans with Red Potatoes- Not Good- The green beans seemed almost canned. The beans might have been frozen but were very grey and over cooked. The potatoes seemed either steamed or boiled. They were not appetizing at all.

Corn Bread with GIANT ball of soft Butter- Good- sort of cake like, a little sweet and studded with corn. Tasted like a mix of cake with cornbread with LOTS of butter soaking in. It was like having a rich dessert. Also giant sized. You will hurt your self if you eat the whole thing.

My husband had the #3 Lo Lo's Plate. It cost $2.00 less than my plate and was a much better value. He had three pieces of chicken and waffles. I tasted a small piece of waffle and it was good.



Between the wait, The not so good fish, processed tasting macaroni and cheese and the not appetizing spicy green beans with red potatoes and the $42.35..brought things down for me.


If you stick with only the things that Lo Lo's does best you will do better than I did.  Go there when you are monstrously hungry.

Fried chicken with Gravy and Onions is my favorite.  Chicken loses some of its crispiness smothered in gravy, but that's a worthwhile trade off.  Sides are either really good or mediocre.  Avoid mac and cheese.  Very disappointing.  Red beans and rice are excellent. Collared greens are the best by far.  Spicy and hearty.  I'm not a big fan of grits, but they were creamy.

If you're planning on going during spring training, be weary of going after a Giants game as Lolo's is right down the street from the stadium and once the game's over, it gets really crowded and the service slows down more than usual.

Kool-Aid served in jugs?  Does it get any better than that?  I think not!

Red velvet cake is really moist and worth the trip by itself (slight exaggeration).

Price is a bit high, but portions are good and I didn't feel ripped off by any means.

I have to say, not the best fried chicken I have ever had, but pretty damn good- it could use more seasoning.  Now the waffles, probably the best ever...  The waffles are deliciously soft inside, a little crispy out with a wonderful cinammoness to them.  The seating is cramped, but it doesn't matter as soon as your food is delivered your table goes quiet, you get tunnel vision and after the first bite you are taken away to an orgy of goodness.

If you are in Phoenix, this is a requirement.  Come real early or be prepared to wait.  Don't forget to order the Red Velvet cake and they have Kool-Aid if that fits your fancy.

I've been coming to Lo Lo's since before the remodel at this location. Recently it's has been a hit or miss. First starting with the wait. I'm used to waiting at least 30 to 45 minutes for a table so the wait time doesn't bother me because I expect it.

I'm not really sure what has happen to the customer service here but ever since the remodel it has not been a priority. Any contact that I have had with any of the staff whether it be the hostess, waiters/waitresses, and even the manager has been negative. After having to deal with the parking nightmare and the wait for a table you expect the experience to get better from there. Not the case here. The only thing that keeps me coming back is the food. 

I usually order the smothered chicken and waffles or the fried catfish with mac and cheese and greens. There was only one time that I had a problem with the food not coming out hot and in a timely manner. They recently came out with an alcoholic beverage menu but I prefer the kool aid. They also have a breakfast menu. You will never leave hungry and the prices are very reasonable.

When I had finally had enough and decided to leave after watching the couple next me (who arrived way after me) receive their order (similar to mine) the waiter wanted me to pay for the mimosa that I had drank because legally they could not ""serve free alcohol"". The only explanation I was offered was that the kitchen was backed up and they apologized. Needless to say I left without paying a dime and unfortunately still hungry.

I went solely for the chicken and waffles, and they more than delivered.  The prices here are much more reasonable than they are at a certain world-famous California-based place, and I'd argue that the food itself is better, too.  The crust on the chicken was light and it was fried perfectly -- crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside -- and the waffles?  Add that to the list of things I could eat all day.  There truly is something magical about a small bundle of fried chicken and a short stack of waffles, drowning in a sea of syrup, butter, and a little hot sauce.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it.

I didn't get to try any of their other stuff, although literally everything on the menu sounded delicious, but then again what soul food dish doesn't?  I went in for a lunch, and other than a kid's birthday party there weren't many people there, so I didn't have any of the long waits or loud guest that apparently plague this location, but I don't know if that would have affected my opinion, because the food was just too good.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"For our Sunday lunch we were in the mood for some Southern cooking and comfort food so we decided to give this place a try.  
We came hungry and left happy!

Location & Aesthetics - located on S Central Ave in Phoenix.  It's a corner restaurant and wasn't difficult to miss with big enough signs.  
The parking lot at the side of the restaurant was on the small side and packed.  Thankfully at the time of our arrival a couple of people were leaving so we got lucky to snag a parking spot.  There's a parking lot across a small street opposite the restaurant which I believe can be used to park as I saw other patrons parking there as well.

The restaurant had plenty of seating both inside, what looked like a back area, and an outside area though there weren't any folks dining outside due to the hot weather but the misters were on.
The restaurant was clean and well lit from light from the outside and inside.  
Noise levels was high with all the dining folks, and I believe there was music playing in the background.  Large screened TV's adorned the walls but were on mute.  The walls also contained paintings and pictures of various musicians and stars.
My suggestion for an arrival time would be early.  We arrived at/around 1-1:30 in the afternoon and there was a wait of about 30 minutes plus the waiting area was packed with only standing room left.
There's only one entry point into the restaurant from the parking lot and that would be on S Central Ave itself.  As you enter, you're greeted by staff then you provide them with your name and how many are in your party.  
If you choose, you can wait around by the door as most people were doing if the one couch they have is occupied or wait outside as I also witnessed folks doing.

Menus - while you wait, you can grab a to-go menu (many copies available) to have a gander of what's on the menu as it was similar to the real one that's provided when you're finally seated.
When you're seated, you're provided with a 4-page colorful, self-explanatory menu that also contained drinks and desserts as well (can't remember if I saw that on the to-go menu).  

Service - All staff, from the folks that greeted us at the front door to our waitress, was super friendly.  
The waitress explained everything and asked if we ever dined there before.  She provided suggestions of the favorite dishes that folks ordered and checked on us periodically throughout our stay.

Food - For me I ordered The Famous Soulfood Platter which came with your 1 choice from eight items plus two sides and it came with a cornbread.  From the 8 items, I chose the 3 pieces of chicken (Southern fried).  You can opt for random pieces or you can pick which ones you want.  For me, I went with the leg, a wing, and breast.  For my 2 sides, I chose the mac n' cheese and the rice with beans.
The wifesky, ordered The Cool Bre Bre's Chicken Salad (field greens, white meat chicken, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes, avocado, applewood bacon & your choice of ranch, raspberry or balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing) and it was huge!  She almost didn't finish but she managed to push through.
For my meal, first the sides - the mac n' cheese - served in a small bowl but was of a heaping portion and wasn't too dried out and sticky, and wasn't too runny either.  It was done just about right because you can't have mac n' cheese done too runny or too dried out in my opinion.  
The rice with beans was to die for.  My only regret was not ordering another side of it.  The rice was well cooked and fresh plus the beans...not sure if it was red beans because it didn't look like baked beans was done to perfection!  It was well cooked and the sauce/gravy it was served in was nicely seasoned with a small kick to it.
The chicken was moist, tender, succulent, fresh, and cooked perfectly.  It was well seasoned and the fried skin/batter wasn't overwhelming so it had enough bite/crunch to it.  The chicken wasn't too oily/greasy 
It was truly Southern styled, comfort food!

* Mac n' cheese - Creamy and satisfying. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ?select=apV6OcH9iItBhrm8An33nw
* Collard greens - Spicy, the flavor seemed a bit muddled, but it was a-okay. 
* Red velvet cake - This was one of the best RV cakes I've tried. Incredibly moist (how did they do it?), very sweet, with fresh pecans on the frosting.

I truly would have given 5 stars if I was basing this review on food alone. However; this review is based off our entire experience.  First let's starts with the 

Pros: the front door staff/ hostess where extremely friendly and were able to seat our party of five in a decent amount of time. The food absolutely hands down delicious. The chicken was moist and perfectly fried to perfection. My collard greens had the right amount of flavor and heat to taste. Don't get me started on the waffles omg AMAZING. I truly enjoyed my food so to the cooks GREAT JOB.

Now on to the 

Cons: our waitress Edith although friendly was not that attentive. I ordered the catfish appetizer and specifically requested it come out prior to our meal.. well that never happened because our food came out before the appetizer. I had to let her know that I no longer wanted it because it was late coming to the table. Also she rarely returned to our table after our orders came out and seemed like other waitstaff was picking up her slack. She forgot or it just took several minutes for her to bring things that our party requested back to the table. For example I order sweet tea which I didn't get until I wad half way through with my meal. Once finished we requested some Togo boxes and a bag which the boxes came out but no bag then had to wait an additional 15 minutes for the bag and check. 

After paying for our meal and getting back home I noticed I was still charged for the catfish appetizer. I called the restaurant and was told to hold while they get Edith on the phone. Once she got on the phone and I explained my calling she said to please hold while she gets the manager to adjust the charges to only be hung up on. I called back and then was reconnected to Edith and was told to hold again while charges are reversed. I waited on hold for about 10 to 15 minutes when finally was told charges had been adjusted. I am just hoping in the few business days it takes to show the reversal on my card that it actually does. 

All and all I loved the restaurant, food, and friendly atmosphere. But didn't care so much for the service received.  I would definitely recommend coming here to eat and enjoy the soulful cooking.

None of my fears were warranted. There's ample street parking at Lolo's. If you have to hoof it a little to get there, you'll appreciate the walk back to the car.

When my son arrived we stood at the door as there were several people waiting to be seated. I received a text from my mother informing me that it would be an hour for the order to be ready. I looked around and there were several empty tables in the middle of the room, 2 empty booths along the window and the banquest room was empty. I approached the counter and asked the hostess if it was really going to take an hour to get a to go? She replied yes, we have people sitting at tables that havent had their orders filled in 30 mins or more. i directed her sight to the multiple open tables and asked for an explanation. She said ""OBVIOUSLY WE'RE BUSY""!! I then asked to speak with the manager, whom happened to be walking up. I stepped to the side to address the manager. I informed the manager that this was my 3rd attempt at getting a to go order. I explained that my family and I go to the Scottsdale location very often. From the start the manager was very condescending. I informed him of my most recent visit to simply get dessert,(Which on that visit I was informed that they were'nt doing to go orders because it slows down the kitchen. But they would see if they could get me a slice of cake)! After explaining my frustration to the manager his reply was simply ""oh well"", while staring blankly into my face. I asked the manager for his name which he gladly offered while extending his hand, ""I'M LARRY WHITE, THE OWNER... I AM LoLo!' Raising his voice and gripping my hand as if to intimidate me! I shook his hand as he squeezed like we were at some stand off in the playground, childish attempt to display authority! I politely informed Mr. White that there was no need to attempt aggression and raise his voice. I reminded him that I was calm and the tone in my voice had not changed AND I would appreciate it if he would not attempt to disrespect me in front of my 4yr old by raising his voice to me. I thanked Mr. White and requested that he cancel my mothers to go order request.

Stupid fries came out first, it's interesting since it has gravy with it. Not bad - I like it.

Okay - so this is the millionare dollar question: How's the Lo-Lo?

I think it's just okay, I don't see what's so special about it. It's just a big piece of waffle, it's not especially crispy or anything. It's soft and soggy. If you like your waffles like that, then maybe it fits you better than for me. The fried chicken was definitely crispy so that's good. It wasn't flavorful though. It just tasted deep fried. I think KFC and Churchs chicken taste better. I rather buy KFC or Church chicken and make my own waffle with my waffle machine and eat it. 

It's a little bit on the saltier end for the chicken but it didn't bother me too much.

Got it to go and glad I did. The chicken was OK but only for the first couple of bites.  The red velvet cake was aweful. 

Background
Yelpers let me down on this one.  I ordered the three piece chicken meal expecting to stuff myself contented with fried goodness and slip into a glycosidic stupor from a criminally sized slab of red velvet cake.  Let me say I didn't have to watch the scale worried of well earned weight gain from this meal.  

The chicken was an initial hit but was short lived.  I didn't finish it nor did I want to.  The waffle did not travel well either, it was soggy by arrival (10 mins to the hotel - arrgh!)  nor was it flavored in any manor. I would liken it to the generic bread slices used at other joints for sopping up the grease.  The red velvet was a crime.

Can't think of anything. So let me keep it short and sweet. It took me longer to find this place than it did to get our food. After all the carrying on I've heard and read about, I was expecting Narnia on a plate.

It wasn't, but it was pretty tasty fare for the price. I had - in order of supreme goodness - the fried chicken, sweet tea, waffle, and mac & cheese. Fried chicken certainly worth the trip. Sweet tea was amazing;  sweet without being sacchariny and blended so perfectly. Waffle was very nice but I've had better (overseas, to be fair) and the mac & cheese was saucy but unspectacular.

I went to LoLo's with Robert and Bacon on a Sunday morning. We were only made to wait for a short time before we entered the shrine of soul food. We were greeted very warmly and asked what we wanted to drink. I had the sweet tea. I usually LOVE sweet tea but they were not messing around! Next time I'll order 1/2 sweet and 1/2 regular tea. For my meal, I got the 2 piece and a waffle. We chose several sides to share between the three of us. We had the red beans and rice, mac and cheese, collard greens and fried okra. 
I was amazed when the food arrived at the table. The waffle was hanging off of the side of my plate and smelled like heaven probably should! I tried the fried chicken and I was taken back to my childhood. The chicken was well seasoned and has a bit of baking powder bite to it! AMAZING. It wasn't at all greasy or soggy in any way. My mouth is watering just typing this review. In the background, there was great gospel music playing so I hope that getting a dose of Jesus while eating fried chicken might banish any of its artery clogging properties.... yeah....

The waffles were fairly standard, but it's hard to really jazz up a waffle.  Add an ice cream scoop's worth of butter and syrup and you are good to go.

Lo-Lo's is about the closest thing I've gotten to soul food since I'd lived in Phoenix.  Though most people go for the chicken and waffles, I much more prefer their smothered chicken with hash browns, collared greens, and sweet yams.  Be forewarned -- the smothered chicken is salty.  Much saltier than most people would prefer, tbh, at least if their palate is fairly ""white"" (as in not eating a lot of spices and salt and whatnot).

The sweet tea is always phenomenal and the red velvet cake is comparable to stuff I've eaten back East (i.e. it's fantastic).

I ordered the BABY RAY (3 pcs of chicken (I chose leg, thigh, and wing) smothered in gravy and onions).  First off, the pieces were just massive.  I mean large, but incredibly juicy and tasty.  The gravy was good, as were the waffles.

I also shared the CHICKEN GIZZARDS & RICE served smothered in onions and gravy.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"I invited my son's club basketball team to have dinner at Lolo's Chicken Waffles located in Phoenix on Saturday June 13th after our games. I had 20 people who RSVP'd to me that they would be coming so I called Lolo's Friday around 4:30 to make reservations because I know how busy that location gets on the weekend. I have made reservations at this location several times before and was told that there would be a $1.00 reservation per person but this time I was told that it would be $5.00 per person. I told the guy that took my reservation that it would not be a problem so he asked me for my credit card to make reservations for 20 people. I called back the next day (Saturday) at 1:50 because I had 7 more people that I had to add to our reservation and they said that would not be a problem they would just have to charge $5.00 per person to add them and I said that was fine because I knew even if we did not get that money refunded we would be spending at least that much. We had a great dinner and our waitress separated our bills like we asked when we had placed our orders. She came out gave everyone their bill and two people paid right away because they had to leave. When everyone else was ready to pay the waitress never came back so I had to go and find out what was going on. This is when I am finally being told that they had already charged my card for the entire party $541.00. I then told the Manager that we had asked for separate bills before we ordered. Then he says that I was charged $25.00 per person because I had made reservations. Well first if all if that was true the amount would not be $541.00 it would have been $500.00 for 20 people because they charged my card Friday the day before I even added the extra 7 people so that is a lie. Then I am being told that because I reserved the party room I was being charged some type of catering party package and they start showing me this contract that I have never seen before. I then tell Chris and the Manager that I did not ask to be put in a party room and if they chose to seat our large party there then that was their choice. I have made reservations there before for our company with large groups and it had never been an issue before. I then ask the waitress what the total bill was for our entire party and she says it was $440.00 so they are overcharging us $101.00! Then they tried to say it was because they charge $25.00 per person and I then told them if it would make sense for someone to make reservations for $25.00 per person when the most expensive item on the menu is $15.00, ridiculous! The manager then had to call the owner twice to explain the situation because they were not going to refund our money. After 40 minutes of him going back and forth on phone with the owner he finally got the approval to give us the refund. First I had to pay our tab which was over $200.00 and then because there were two families that had paid and left I had to pay their tabs too because they had issued a refund back to their cards because they actually thought that we were going to just pay the $541.00 like we were idiots! So I ended up paying $140.00 for those tabs as well. Then the manager goes to do our refund and he does not have the authorization to complete a refund for that amount, UNBELIEVABLE! So then we are told that we would get a call back on Sunday to get it taken care of and nobody calls us back so I have to end up calling them. I talked to Chris on the phone and he then tells me that the owners are on vacation and they will not be able to issue the refund until they come back to town. What kind of owners does not empower their managers to make decisions and issue refunds, but also what type of customer service is that! I ended up having over $800.00 taken out of our account just for dinner!! The account that was used belongs to our club team account that is a non-profit, so now our team is out $541.00 that is raised by the players with sponsorships and donations to use to pay for gym fees and tournaments and now we do not have those funds to use. That is not all, I then call another location and I am told that the owners are not on vacation and the only way to communicate with them is to go online and submit a request, even after we had given specific instructions to the managers Saturday night that we wanted a phone call from the owners. I sent this exact letter to the owners on their website like I was told and to this day I still have not received one response from anyone at Lolo's. I had to dispute the charges with my bank finally because our team needs the money to pay for our gym this week and a tournament.

As we watched people who were seated long after us be served my rumbling tummy began to wonder where the F my food was. Our waitress didn't come back that entire time to check on us so I couldn't really update my stomach on the sitch. On a time restraint and irritated my adorable boyfriend (I have one now) flagged down an employee and ask them to check on our order as basically everyone else in the restaurant but us was eating. At this point our waitress finally surfaced for the first time in 45 minutes. We asked her how everyone who was seated after us was already eating and she told us TO ASK THE KITCHEN. Are you kidding me?! Also, they messed up my boyfriend's order and didn't give him all his food but we couldn't tell her because she vanishes like.. I don't know, anything that vanishes quickly and for long periods of time that doesn't want to return. We asked for the manager at this point and told him what the waitress said/ about the wait/ the food and he also blamed the kitchen. I feel really bad for the inanimate kitchen at this point. It gets blamed for everything. I don't think the kitchen is to blame when people who come in well after us get their food before us but I also haven't really worked in the industry so I might be wrong. Strong sense says she simply didn't put our food in and doesn't know how to take responsibility. The manager didn't apologize for the waitress' attitude or take anything off the bill for us waiting nearly an hour and messing up our order or for their service. He did offer a free dessert, however, it was 10 in the morning and we were already over their bologna. My suggestion- Take some ownership! This was our first time in your establishment. You guys messed up. You let us sit there for 50 minutes after we placed our order watching people who sat down after us eating without ever checking in on us. We had to flag you down. Your waitress told us to go in the back AND ASK THE KITCHEN WHAT WAS TAKING SO LONG. Listen, if I knew I could freely go in the kitchen I would have made a snack because I was hungry as all get out.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"We were stopping over from TX on our way back to Las Vegas. I had bookmarked this place even before we had left for TX, so I made it clear that when we head back after our trip...we would come here to eat.

We did that.

It was really easy to find. Pulling in I could see there were people waiting outside for their turn at some Lolos. We didn't get deterred because it didn't look that bad of a wait. Entering the restaurant...it was packing in there! It was a Sunday afternoon around 1 something, and it was filled! Anyway, we were told twas going to be a 45 minute wait. Initially, I thought crap...only because we had been driving since El Paso and there were hungry lions to be fed. THANKFULLY, we didn't have to wait for 45 minutes. Apparently, most the folks waiting ahead of us lost patience and left. Welp, yay for us. Hallelujuer. Think we waited for about 20minutes.

We get seated and was not immediately greeted by a waiter/tress. But, I didn't mind because we were trying to tame these wild animals into their seats all while trying to stare at the menu (which btw we were already staring at the to-go menus they had available as we were waiting to be seated). I'd say 5 minutes later our waitress comes by and tells us she'll be right with us as she has dirty plates in tow. 

She comes back, we order immediately. Hungry and on a time battle here. I ordered the toy-toy. 2 wings and a waffle. The boys ordered their chicken tenders that come with cornbread, and the husband orders 3pc chicken with waffles. 

Dining out I am not one to order fried chicken. Mainly because I've tried chicken that isn't home cooked and they've all tasted nasty. Like, well cooked on the outside...still soggy from the batter on the inside, salty, peppery, lack of meat, oily, etc...so ordering the 2 wings was ideal for me because incase I did not like the chicken...it wouldn't be much chicken to eat, thus, wouldn't be much chicken to go to waste.

Never fails, the 1 time I'm being cautious is the 1 time.im thinking, damnt! Their chicken was NOT dry. It was moist, seasoned properly, and just cooked almost perfectly. I say almost because I like my wings to be extra crispy. But for someone who doesn't order chicken dining out, it was close to perfect. The waffle was nice and soft with crisp edges. 

Tried my boys tenders and those things were fat and moist as well! The cornbread, however, which comes with their plate was overcooked. You could tell it was just by looking at it. It looked like it was 5 minutes away from becoming burnt. I love cornbread. However, I didn't love cornbread on this day. 

Also, the fries that came with my boys' plates...I felt were way too seasoned. I had to dust off the seasoning just so my toddler can enjoy it properly. It just became way too salty after each fry. 

In conclusion, it's a chicken and waffle joint. Their chicken and waffle did not disappoint at all! They do have LOTS of other items on their menu if chicken and waffles aren't your fancy. I can see where people may feel they are pricey in some parts of their menu, but from my quick experience...it's worthed. I really wish we had more time so I could explore their other items, but we will save that for another trip. We had a nice experience, despite the children going wild. Lol.

So I took a seat and waited. It came out in 12 mins. So I went out side and ate it in my car. The chicken had really good flavors and was juicy. But it was a bit too salty. I'm not sensitive to salt and that was too much for me. The waffle taste like a waffle. It had a bit of cinnamon which I liked. But the waffle had no crunch at all. It came completely soft. I was looking forward to the crunch. That's why I ate it there and didn't wait to get it home. The Mac n cheese was good. Not great. It wasn't as creamy as I thought or wanted it to be. It was kind of thick. The kool aid tasted bad. I was looking forward to it too. It tast like the artificial sweetner mixed with those little squeeze flavor things that you put in water. Over all it wasn't that bad. I want to give it one more try. Maybe it was an off day.,3,[u' really good'],0.7,"[u' not sure', u' Not great', u' artificial sweetner']",-1.25

Q: do you like fried chicken? 

If you answered ""yes"" proceed to Lo-Lo's. 

If you answered ""no"",  then what in the hell is wrong with you? 

Seriously, go get a chicken leg from anywhere else that sells chicken legs. 

Go on. I'll wait.

Now, look at the chicken leg that you just brought over here to me and compare it to...

THIS BIG-ASS MONSTROUS LEG FROM A REAL CHICKEN THAT THEY ARE GONNA SERVE YOU AT LO-LO's!

Not only is this leg three times bigger than that lil ole scrawny bantam leg you got, but it's ten times as juicy and tastes like the good Lord done blessed whatever chicken it came from with the most delicious chicken genes he could find!

I am glad I did but not so much.  The chicken was very good.  They pulled a Church's number and added parts of the breast to every wing, giving you a big piece of meat.  The breading was tasty and the meat was moist and juicy.  However, that was where it ended for me.  The waffle was okay, it had a cinnamon taste to it that was different but it was very thin and small (maybe I am just used to Roscoe's).  The mac and cheese was very rich but too rich.  I was basically cheese sauce with some macaroni thrown in.  I couldn't complete the whole thing.  I was just about on my way out the door when I saw someone's sweet potato pie.  I turned back around and ordered one for dessert.  Shouldn't of done that.  I was not impressed with the taste so that was wasted also.

I really wanted Chicken & Waffles for breakfast and the Clarendon Hotel I was staying at used to have this item on their menu. Since I had the craving for Chicken & Waffles the nice staff at the hotel recommended Lolo's Chicken & Waffles. I was not disappointed, the food was amazing, the service was attentive and friendly. The only thing I didn't like was the over one hour wait to get a table. After being seated in the restaurant I can see why seating is an issue, this place is a converted small house and the dining area is limited. The Fried Chicken & Waffles my friend and I had along with the cornbread, mac n cheeze and the Iced tea & Lemonade combo was off the hook.

and Samuel L. Jackson (Q: what's the ""L"" stand for"" in Samuel L. Jackson?) gets a very skinny time-gone-by Chris Tucker in the trunk of that dirty ass car by the promise of, and I just guessing here, ""Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles""...and since that time I've meant to go to Lo-Lo's.  And I just never made it until now.

When I saw a gorgeous fried chicken breast from Lo-Lo's at a D-backs game, but at $8, and that's no misprint, that's EIGHT DOLLARS FOR A SINGLE CHICKEN BREAST, I thought, well, now it's time to go to Lo-Lo's because I do want to try it but not at $8.  1/2 that outside the ballyard. 

This week, June 2015, I got down there and I know 3 things to be true:

*1:  Really, really good chicken breast. I got a #8: one breast, waffle, $8.  One breast on the side, +$4.  Moist, very juicy. see photos.  Very, very good.

*2:  Mac & Cheese is crazy good.  I will never again eat Kraft; it was only passable to ghetin with but now I'm spoiled, absolutely delicious.  $4, a small portion, I'm guessing 4oz, so good it doesn't matter the size.  Very, very good. 

3:  $7 FOR A 10 OZ BEER IN A 12 OZ GLASS IS JUST...unexpected. TOO MUCH!  CRIMINAL.  NFW!

You can make the case that I should have looked at the menu.  But here in America, we come to expect certian things. and a $7, 12 oz beer that really was poured so much earlier, the head had disappeared and it was really 11oz, not that cold, SEVEN FRICKING DOLLARS! for a draft beer is out-friggin'-rageous!!!!

I'd go back but I'll stop at Hazelwoods for a good, cold beer, priced like we expect it to, then I'll go eat the chicken.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"OH.MY.GOODNESS! I don't know that there is anything on the menu that is bad! My boyfriend and I wanted to go out to eat on a Saturday night. We were starved but couldn't decide. I usually pick the region of food and he picks the restaurant (bc he's from here and I'm not). I said hearty American food or American bistro. We decide as we're walking to the car....CHICKEN AND WAFFLES. So random. 

We get to Lolo's and I'm loving the atmosphere. The art on the walls is cool. The music is good. Everyone looks happy to be stuffing their faces. I see mason jars with colorful drinks all over which really sparked my interest. BUT decided against booze and went with a traditional sweet tea. Holy cow was this sweet tea everything I hoped it would be. It reminded me of sweet tea in the south. Like Georgia south. The REAL south. Not too sugary but not super bitter. It was just right and so refreshing. 

We got an app sampler platter. Fried okra, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese, and slaw. The fried okra was crispy and seasoned to perfection. The potatoes were creamy. The mac n cheese was probably my favorite. You know when the cheese is sharp enough that it doesn't need seasoning and does that warm gooey thing when you pull it apart. Ya ...it was like that! The slaw wasn't soggy like most slaw is at bbq joints. It was still crispy and very flavorful. 

Then dinner came! We both opted for chicken and waffles. The chicken was so moist and the batter was fried for the perfect amount of time. Its like they have it down to a science in the kitchen here. The outside is crispy and seasoned well and the inside is moist and hot. The waffle was delicious. It almost had a sweet flavor too it. It wasn't chewy it wasn't soggy. It was as if the food was plated, put in the window, and whisked away to our tables immediately. Each bite I took I made sure to have an equal chicken to waffle ratio and dabbed it in syrup then in a little hot sauce. My mouth is watering just reminiscing about this meal lol. The prices are on point. The serving sizes are HUGE...so in reality you get more than what you're paying for.

The sweet tea was pretty authentic and came in a huge mason car for $3.50. 

We ordered our food around 1pm and it came out almost an hour later.....
The place was busy but the food probably should not have taken an hour to come out. I think something was wrong with their fryer. The manager came out after an hour after we kept asked where our food was. She apologized and brought out the food around 15 min later. They also mixed up one of the orders and gave the girl the completely wrong order. My co -worker who ordered the catfish platter only got one of the meats he ordered because the fryer was broken. I think it was just bad news bear overall. They gave us free banana bread pudding at the end but it wasn't really consolation for what happened. 

The drumsticks were pretty dry - popeyes is def better. I would give the mac and cheese 5 stars- def tasted homemade and I really enjoyed it but otherwise the food was just average.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"One delirious food coma, a heavy dollop of cholesterol, two thick slices of saturated fat and a mild case of diabetic shock, to go please!

Translation: Let's split the sweet tea, a pile of fried chicken, some waffles, the fried okra, cheesy eggs with onions, a bowl of mac n' cheese and a slice of red velvet cake to go. 

Brimstone was on the air, a haunting violin dirge could be heard wafting through my head, and a sinking feeling settled at the bottom of my gut. We just made a deal with the devil and we didn't even know it. 

That or I was just too hungry to function properly.

But I do know that I would do terrible, devious things in the name of these chicken and waffles. Pawnshops would know me by name and assume I had a hard drug problem, but my only addiction would be the sweet fried perfection of Lolo's Chicken and Waffles!

Perfectly spiced, crisp but not overly battered, moist fried chicken that even Colonel Sanders would sell his soul for, provided he hasn't already done so in his quest for chicken dominance. 

Crunchy, buttery waffles with a hint of sweetness that are good on their own or smothered in warm maple syrup, that totally wipe the floor with those perpetratin' Waffle House hockey pucks.

Creamy, cheesy, smooth and decadent mac and cheese. A tribute to the best of Granny's kitchen and an affirmation that Kraft should be drawn and quartered for their powdered cheese monstrosity.

And sweet tea that quenches the thirst and makes your teeth hurt its so effing good! Or red Kool-aid, lemonade, fountain drinks, or regular unsweetened tea for you nonbelievers out there.

Almost everything at Lolo's is done well, except for their red velvet cake. It's dense and moist but the devil's food taste (it's chocolate cake with about three bottles of red food coloring in it for those of you that think red is the flavor) is weak and the cream cheese frosting was so thin that there wasn't nearly enough to lubricate the bland, meaty red slice. It was a disappointment.

I came on a Wednesday 2pm. It was perfect!! No line and waiter was on top of her game.

Bloody Bacon Mary- i'm always looking to try something different. Bacon in my vodka cocktail isn't something everyone serves so i figured give it a shot. I wont order this item again but then again I don't like v8.
Mojitos are good. The balance of mint to sweetness was ride up my alley. I prefer a bit most alcohol punch but I can't complain this isn't a bar. 

Too my surprise they have BEER ON TAP. I stuck to Goose Island IPA this stuff is so good. Bourbon pigment, hoppy/malt flavor a little low in alcohol (below 6% abv) but perfect for lunch time. 

Appetizers:
 Catfish Beignets they were white and tender on the inside and crispy on the outside their dipping sauce complimented the dish exceptionally good. The fried mushrooms and zucchini don't compare to the catfish.
Lunch:
Chicken/Waffles its their specialty so they really can't screw this up. Good chicken and good waffles.

Let me just say, I can't believe it took me 4 years to come here, no seriously, I have to slap myself silly for that because LoLo's has renewed my faith in fried chicken. Seriously, I think that was the best fried chicken I've had in my life. The chicken was fried to a perfection, nice golden crisp with minimal grease, that's right, MINIMAL grease! I didn't think that was physically possible for fried chicken but LoLo's debunked that myth! I have the #7, which was 3 chicken wings and a waffle. I've already swooned over the fried chicken, now the waffle was ok, nothing too special, same stuff you get at a waffle house. I still can't get over the friend chicken though.....Anyways, I really liked the atmosphere here, on the south end of downtown, this place gets crazy packed for lunch. A lot of regulars come here and it's obvious from the waiters and waitresses hootin and hollering at the customers when they come in by their first names, kind of cool!

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"After a fun, alcohol filled night, my friends and cousins decide to hit up LoLo's.  I hadn't been here since they were just a back room to somebody's kitchen so seeing the expansion gave me high hopes because it presented itself nicely...the interior is the ONLY thing that presents itself well.

We walk in and the unenthusiastic hostess asked how many was in our party and I told her 8.  Being that the rest of the party live further, it would take them a while, so she informed us she can't seat half of our party until the full 8 showed up. Ugh yeah, right. I'm hungry and I'm not waiting so we just asked to be seated for our four. So after letting her know it would just be us for, she writes my name and instructs me to ""scoot""  to the side and sit down. In slow motion, I turn around and all of the waiting benches are taken soooo where the hell am I suppose to sit, on the older ladies lap that was already sitting there?! She could have easily said ""it will just be a few moments, if you'd like you can take a seat that's available behind you"". Was that too difficult?! So I say whatever, they sat us within the next two minutes.

Our waiter/manager of the restaurant takes our drink orders and he seemed pretty cool cuz he was joking a lil with us.  So my cousin asks if she can put in an order for someone who was showing up a little later and then that's when things went down hill.  We were informed we couldn't do that because it would be cold by the time he came and blah blah blah.  Brotha, that's another order which results into money into your business' pocket.  So we order our food but he let's us order for our cousin who would show up late.  So we place the order and literally 5 minutes later, a different server comes out and says ""UM this is for someone showing up late or somethin"".  Ok, so you mean to tell me there was a discussion about this tiny little request in your kitchen amongst several servers.  Not to mention our order hadn't even come out yet, so the ""complicated"" order was first to come out when our orders were the smallest.  My friend asks why my cousins order came out so fast and why we haven't received ours, so that's when the title of this review comes in ""ma'am we cook chicken and waffles all day, some orders will be quicker than others"". Huh?! I know I didn't major in computer science but this really wasn't THAT complex.  So luckily my cousin walks in just in time to eat his food so it didn't get cold like Mr. Manager/Waiter/Host/Fry Cook (he seriously wore many hats) mentioned. 

I don't wanna come to a place to eat when there's all these rules and instructions beginning with who and how many people can sit with me.  Being a California native, Roscoe's will always be THE Chicken & Waffles place that dominates any other competition.  Compared to Roscoe's, this place is amateur.  At least with Scoes they seat you no matter what time your party arrives, your food comes out within 5-10 minutes from the time you place your order, and you have a server who is just that...a server.  Not the building instructor, valet attendant or whatever our so called 'server' was to us.

YPavuOh2XsnRbLfl0DH2lQ,"Well, after being browbeaten by everyone I know who has been there some friends and I finally decided to make the drive down town to try Lo Lo's.

Following everyone else's advice here on Yelp we got there 10mins before they opened last Sunday. We were the 5th group in line and by the time the doors opened there was a pretty good sized line. As soon as we sat down I got up to use the bathroom (morning coffee works fast!) and noticed that EVERY table was full. I mean every table (this is approximately 45 seconds after opening the doors). 

Now, I worked in the restaurant business for over 5 years and that would have been a NIGHTMARE at any of the places I worked at. I was intrigued to see how they would handle it. 

They used a ""shotgun"" approach to serving, we saw at least half a dozen servers throughout our entire meal asking and getting us what we needed. The service was not notably friendly, but it was fast and efficient and there was almost always a server within earshot if we needed something. I have no complaints here, but I am relatively easy to please on the service side (probably the 5 years doing it myself ;)
Anyway, on to the food, we all tried to order so that we could try all the ""famous"" items. So I ended up having some of each of the following: Chicken, Waffles, Grits, Cheese Eggs, and Fried Okra.
I am going start at the best and move down. One caveat before we begin, I am not at all a fried chicken fan, I eat it on occasion but have never been excited about it or sought it out. 

1.) The Chicken: It was absofreakinlutely amazing. I am talking breathtakingly good. I'm talking take a bite and then hold it out in front of you to look at it to make sure it is just a piece of fried chicken in your hand. It was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside and not at all greasy. I don't know what they put in the batter but it was awesome. I am starting to salivate right now actually. I did try it true southern style with syrup on it, which was good, but I stopped because I felt the syrup was detracting from the overall flavor. I am not going to attempt to describe the taste, you are just going to have to go and try it for yourself; I will never do it justice. By FAR the best fried chicken I have ever eaten. All of this impression was with going in there with REALLY high expectations, if that tells you something.

2.) The Waffles: Like I just mentioned, I went to Lo Lo's with really high expectations because of friends and Yelp reviews. I was not disappointed here either. They were very, very tasty, and even slightly exceeded my expectations. They are the best waffles I have ever had, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside, smothered in butter and syrup YUM. I cleared my plate despite the physical pain of eating so much. I would go back here just for the waffles, but I have to admit, the margin by which the chicken exceeded my expectations was much larger.

3.) The Grits: They were very good; I probably won't get them next time, not because they were lacking but because they would take up valuable chicken and waffle space in my stomach. My only previous experience with grits was in the Army, and obviously, this was an entirely different species of grits.

4.) The Cheese Eggs: These were tasty, fluffy and cheesy, overall exceptional eggs. Mine got a little syrup and butter on them which actually were really good. I can't decide if I would forfeit more bits of chicken and waffles for them though =P

5.) The Fried Okra: Also very good, and a great appetizer. We had a native Texan with us who is a rabid okra fan and she said they were the best fried okra she had ever had. For me though, they will likely go the way of the grits next time.

For drinks we all got tea, mine was the only unsweet one (which was really good). The sweet tea fans in the group said it was the best sweat tea they have had in Arizona.

Overall we got our food fast, our drinks stayed full and the food was phenomenal and even better than were expecting (and we were expecting greatness). I will now be a regular customer and am going to start browbeating my friends that haven't tried it yet to go with me ;)

Now let's be clear: this isn't the place for dieters. It's not a place for any pretentious behavior. The place has ""Chicken & Waffles"" in the name, OK? And that's what you're going to get. In abundance.

Cheap as hell. I had the #1, also known as KK's. Three huge-ass pieces of chicken -- breas, thigh and mutant leg. All battered and fried to perfection. Two waffles the size of Vermont. A bucket of grits with some egg/cheese/onion concoction on the side. OK, I could have done without the last part. But hey, when in a chicken & waffle place...

My favorite hole-in-the-wall comfort food in south Phoenix. While this ain't no Roscoe's Chicken and Waffles, Lo-Lo's is a decent Arizona cousin. Most of the time, I can't bring myself to support such a rip on an original restaurant idea that's been made to seem like it's the only one of its kind, but in my four years in Arizona, I have to admit I've gobbled up many calories here. 

Don't let the neighborhood or the space keep you away. It's a little on the dingy side, but the people are the nicest around and they're super helpful. Obviously, you'll want to get chicken and waffles. The chicken is crispy and flavorful, but it differs from Roscoe's because it is sometimes dry-- I go for the white meat, which usually stays a little juicier. The waffles are good, but they're not the best. They get the job done, but lack the cinnamon-y flavors of Roscoe's. I usually get a side of home-fries, which are sometimes amazing, sometimes just average, and a big jug of red cool aid. 

I'm usually pretty stuffed by the time dessert rolls by, but word on the street is, they've got a decent red velvet cake. Park on the street, but make sure to read the signs/ lock your doors.

Deep in our DNA, we are still pack animals (as in ""a scrum of rugby's"", as opposed to pack animals as in ""pack all that crap on that animals back and let's go"").
My sense of needing to belong was what brought me to Lolo's Chicken and Waffles a few years ago, and my sense of ""I haven't had a decent chicken and waffles fix for a while"" brought me back today!
You won't see me wax rhapsodic over the flavor and lightness of the perfectly crusty and delectable fried chicken...I won't fawn over whoever is in the kitchen turning out delicious waffle after delicious waffle.
I can't sit here all afternoon and go on and on about the many delectable sides like the buttery and cheesy grits, the melt in your mouth fried okra, and the gallons and gallons of sweet tea or homemade lemonade that you can consume with your lunch at Lolo's.
It's not the interesting menu items like fried gizzards, and fish and grits, that you just can't get other places that stir my soul.
I'm not moved to hyperbole (pronounced ""high-per-bowl"":) by the blending of sweet maple syrup, buttered waffles and savory fried chicken on the plate.

And if you make the trip and are prepared to wait around an hour in eager anticipation of such a feast, you will be well rewarded for your efforts. It's a converted house without much in the way of seating and usually plenty of people ready to raise their cholesterol levels a couple notches.

You will also likely spend an hour or more at the table with the glacial Southern service.

You have to get chicken and waffles the first time you go, preferably with a side and some of their red velvet cake to go. But they have several other unhealthy options and a good amount of breakfast food if that's what your in the mood for. But make no mistake, there is NO healthy option at this place. Don't go there unless you are ready to indulge.

I always order the Betty Boop. Great waffle. Good chicken (make sure you try maple syrup on the chicken...weird but delicious).

Unfortunately, with limited food to choose from and slow service (despite the feeling we got that everyone working was just trying to go home and not be bothered) - tonight was the exception. 

We had butts in the booth at 9:59 tonight, and as the waitress handed us menus we were told they only serve chicken and waffles after 10 pm. NO sides - no eggs - nothing but chicken and waffles. Couldn't even get a salad. Fine, except that the table immediately ahead of us was able to order whatever they wanted, and we were the only other table waiting to order. Seriously, guys? The cut-off is THAT strict? We could HEAR that family order. That's BS. Not to mention, since all we had to choose from was chicken and waffles, why waste our time by giving us menus? Y'all. Get it together. 

Then, 20 minutes AFTER we put our order in (which was at 10:05 btw), a server delivers mac-n-cheese to a different table. Tell me again why you can't send a side over to our table at the same time? Smh. 

Somewhere between being charged for a lemonade we didn't order and it taking forever for the waitress to come back for our checks, I lost a little faith in Lolo's. I usually eat a lot earlier and now that I know about it, the limited menu after 10 won't be an issue for me. I just won't come then.

I've lived in the south and grits never grew on me.  It's been so long since I tried them and the reviews were stellar; I thought I'd give them a second chance.

The chicken is tender, juicy, and fried to perfection here. Not overly greasy. The waffles? Just perfect waffles with lots of flavor. The grits? Buttery. The Eggs? Tastes like crack when its scrambled with onions. The drinks/kool-aid? Ridiculous size. The gravy?

RIDICULOUS. Getting the gravy on the side is the best decision you'll ever make. Unlike Roscoe's, which pairs regular brown gravy, Lo-lo's pairs some sort of spiced and onioned concoction that reminds me of the drippings gravy you make on Turkey Day.

My daughter and I Were craving a greasy cheese pizza and hot wings. I try to keep our business in the neighborhood knowing how bad the construction is due to the light rail people try their hardest to avoid it at all cost. When we went in it was dead like usual. I noticed that the two guys working there were new and Tony wasn't there. I asked the gentleman behind the counter what ""specials"" they had, cause usually it's posted on the wall. He rudely said in a heavy accent ""that special over there is the only one I have""; which was a lg. Cheese pizza with 20 wings for $19.99. We ordered even though I was disappointed that their weren't more to choose from. 

As I made my order, the guy still being rude as hell, I told him that I wanted to split the favor of the wings to 10 hot and 10 BBQ. Not only did he try to charge me a ""carry out"" fee of $2 but then he tried to charge me a additional $1 fee for SPLITTING up the wing flavor. I informed him that we've been eating there for a long time and I've never been charged those addl fees. He shrugged his shoulders and said with a cocky attitude ""well that's how the owner wants it"". So I told him ""well I'm not paying those fees, that's seriously ridiculous""! He then waived at me and told me ""BYE"". 

I could of swore the name of the restaurant game was to keep your loyal customers so they at least keep coming back. Even if it means not charging those ridiculous fees.

Uncle Tony's is sketchy, yes. Shattered windows and dark parking lot. 

The workers are a rough around the edges, yes.

The interior leaves a lot to be desired. A LOT. 

Now I don't know about you all, but I will set all of that aside for a good neighborhood pizza. Uncle Tony's is a good neighborhood pizza. 

Ordered: Large Pizza and Wings-I think it was 20 bucks. Added Pepperoni. That and two drinks I think the total was $26, maybe $28. That's a heck of a deal. 

Wings came out quick-and were delivered to the table. Crunchy wings are my favorite, and these were good wings. 20 wings was what the deal said, I think I counted 24. Score!

Pizza came out in good timing, about 3/4 of the way through the wings. Greasy, big pizza. Good and suitable, if not exciting. Sometimes you just want a greasy pizza.

rWvn5iE53sHqRXPyzWc0TQ,"We visited Uncle Tonys for the first time. I wanted some pasta so I figured my family and I would give them a shot. Upon entry I was a little hesitant. The place was dirty, there were several employees sitting in the dining area watching TV, there were dishes with old food on them sitting on top of a garbage can by the register. The decor was really out dated and the menu was a challenge to read but I thought we'd still give it a try. The girl behind the counter wasnt friendly and looked annoyed that she had to take our order(another red flag.) My niece ordered a slice of pep, my mother in law a slice of sausage and fried mushrooms, the husband ordered the ""grilled chicken Alfredo"" dinner and I ordered the chicken parmigiana dinner. First the salad and bread was brought out. The bread was delicious and fresh tasting. The salad with the Italian dressing was tasty as well. My niece and mother in laws slices came out first. They were happy with the pizza but the mushrooms were over breaded, bland and the ranch tasted flavorless. So needless to say things weren't off to the greatest start. Shortly after my husband was served his Alfredo. He didn't have any complaints other than the chicken being dry. I tasted it and by the looks of it, it had been boiled, and not grilled as the menu stated it was supposed to be. It was chewy, flavorless and had a grey color to it. A few minutes later my food was brought to the table. I crossed my fingers hoping it would be better but I was disgusted. The chicken was again BOILED to death! I make chicken parm all the time myself and I have eaten it many times at many other restaurants and I'm certain the chicken is supposed to be breaded and baked NOT BOILED. The pasta that was served with it was al dente and the sauce was good but the amount of water that was on the plate from the noodles was completely unnecessary. I'm not one to brush something under the rug, so I brought the plate to the front, told the cook it was inedible and asked for meatballs instead. I watched him plop 4 meatballs from a water bin on to a plate and cover them with sauce. My question is, why would you put meatballs in water if you have marinara sauce instead??? After tasting the meatballs I was surprised because they were good, just a little water logged. The cook asked what was wrong with the chicken and I told him the chicken was dry, tough and flavorless. He mumbled something and went back into the kitchen. The fresh pies they were pumping out looked AMAZING and smelled delicious. So maybe they should focus more on the pizza and stay away from the hot dishes.

For the people interested in the short review it is the best pizza around, beats the local chains that include Streets of NY, Pizza Hut and Papa Johns. They have really good deli sandwiches, our favorite is there Pastrami. as well as full Italian dinners. The food is really good the location is pretty standard, they have beer and games on the TV's, it was a pizza restaurant in a former incarnation. The food gets 5 stars and the place gets 4, I am gonna lean toward 5 stars for the Review.

A comment to the folks that gave this place only 1 star... Are you sure you didn't walk in to Pizza Hut? The Subway is right next door, did your buddy switch sandwiches on you? Really so wonderful to be able to get a hot sandwich or a hoagie from right across the street that is this good. MOM & POP shops can have an off day now and again, so far we have not experienced that here.

They have a lunch special that is 2 slices and a soda for $4.50, or any sandwich and a soda for $5.99. We have had at least 3 different ones all hot and very tasty. The Pastrami, the Beef & Cheese, and the Philly style Beef, Mushroom, Cheese. We have been very happy with the NY Style thin crust pizza. 

The other special that is worth crowing about is the large pizza and 20 wings any style... Mild Medium, Hot, BBQ ... maybe more all for $20 dollars. That is a value!

rWvn5iE53sHqRXPyzWc0TQ,"Tony's is my neighborhood pick for good pizza and Italian food. It's even served with a (small) amount of NY attitude to let you know you're getting the real deal. Seriously though, my BF and I have ALWAYS had fantastic, fast service any time we've eaten in or picked up.

We usually go for the classic pepperoni (delicious) but have also enjoyed the ""Taste of Italy Special"" and the spinach pizza. BF also often orders the subs, calzones and wings and I've tried a few of the pasta dishes and we have yet to be disappointed.

Give them a try! You won't regret it. We're so glad they came to the neighborhood!",4,"[u' good pizza', u' fast service', u' so glad']",1.4,[],0

I have lived in NYC twice, and I  love the pizza there, always missing it and wishing I could find it in here in  PHX.  When a friend brought me to Uncle Tony's, I  have to say, I was blown away,  I was SOOOO pleased.  I ordered 2 slices and a drink.....and it was by far the very best pizza I have ever had in PHX AZ  EVER.  If you have not been here, you are missing out, for it is as authentic as it gets.

rWvn5iE53sHqRXPyzWc0TQ,"After an hour wait time, after being told to expect 35 minutes for delivery, and extremely awkward man handed me my pizza and wings while a 2nd employee (I assume his trainer) watched. I paid via card and asked if they needed to see the card or have me sign anything. The awkward man muttered something about it already being paid for and shuffled off. I was unable to tip the man as I did not have cash and they didn't have a method for me to tip on the card.


I brought the plain brown pizza box inside and opened it up, expecting to an extra large Buffalo Chicken Pizza (the size seemed a bit small, 15"" for those looking for hard numbers, I measured).

Buffalo Chicken Pizzas are a thing that a couple pizza places will do, but this was by far the worst I've ever had.

I'm not sure where the Buffalo part was supposed to come in, but this was a thin, dry, pizza with meager amounts of cheese and large chunks of chicken. The pizza itself had no flavour until I bit into a piece of chicken, at which point I spit it out what tasted like a brick of black pepper.

I attempted to move on to the garlic parmesan wings, but after a single wing, I felt as if I had enough salt and sodium to last me a week.

The pizza sits on my table as I write this, with two bites out of it, atop it, the box of 9 uneaten wings, and there they will stay until I throw it away tomorrow.

rWvn5iE53sHqRXPyzWc0TQ,"Before ordering a pizza and wings from this place I was stoked that maybe we had found a great pizza joint down the street...I WAS SO WRONG. 

We ordered a standard... Sausage and onion. When we it it home we were disgusted! There was probably half and onion on more on a medium sized pizza, the cheese was hardly stringy and the sausage was so ground it looked almost like pepper sprinkled on top. We were disappointed to say the least. 

We took it back to them, Wanted a refund. They refused to do anything about it calling them selfs professionals.... Blah blah blah. Obviously the guy making the pizzas was a noob or what ever. Eff this place. NOT COMING BACK. 

They will probably fall off the map soon. All the reviews that are posted have to be fake. Even the pictures. Nothing like what was in our box.",1,[u' great pizza'],0.8,"[u' SO WRONG', u' hardly stringy']",-0.791666667

We were wanting pizza or better our grandson wanted pizza do we picked the first one we passed and this was the place. I/We will be back.
My wife waned a thin crust pizza and I got the wings. The wings were good but it is hard to rate a place on wings. I have eaten then at many places and all are pretty much the same. It is hard to mess up wings. 
The pizza was excellent at least that is what my wife said and our grandson seemed to also enjoy. 
This is not what really made the trip or dining experience great. It was the people. The man that waited or took our order was extremely nice and helpful. Better service is not to be had anywhere. At the end or the meal he brought out a bag of chips for our grandson for the trip home.
